The purpose of this project is to provide an independent open
source implementation of Google Drive client for GNU/Linux. It
uses the Google Document List API to talk to the servers in Google.
The code is written in standard C++.

Currently as of version 0.2.0, grive can do two-side synchronization
between the Google Drive and local directory. It can download and
upload changed files. New directories in Google Drive and local
directory will also be downloaded/uploaded.
