WebSocket++ is a header-only C++ library that implements RFC6455
The WebSocket Protocol. It allows integrating WebSocket client and
server functionality into C++ programs. It uses interchangeable
network transport modules, including one based on raw char buffers,
one based on C++ iostreams, and one based on Asio (either via Boost
or standalone). End users can write additional transport policies
to support other networking or event libraries as needed.
