Coursera provides a variety of massive open online courses (MOOC)
covering many different topics. This script makes it easier to batch
download lecture resources (e.g., videos, ppt, etc) for Coursera classes. 
Given one or more class names and account credentials, it obtains week
and class names from the lectures page, and then downloads the related
materials into appropriately named files and directories.
