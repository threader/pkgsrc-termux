Welcome to GNU ccRTP, the RTP protocol stack of GNU Common C++ and the
GNU project.  GNU ccRTP was created as a "generic" and high performance
RTP stack and uses queued packet lists for both sending and receiving of
realtime data.  A single scheduler thread both schedules delivery of
timestamped outgoing packets, and processes incoming packets into the
receive queue.  A seperate thread or process can then feed data into the
stack for delivery and process pending requests without interfering with
the stack service thread itself.
