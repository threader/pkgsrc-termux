Gitso is a frontend to reverse VNC connections. It is meant to be a simple
two-step process that connects one person to another's screen. First, the
support person offers to give support. Second, the person who needs help
connects and has their screen remotely visible. Because Gitso is cross-
platform and uses a reverse VNC connection, it greatly simplifies the
process of getting and providing support.
