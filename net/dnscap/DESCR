dnscap is a network capture utility designed specifically for DNS
traffic.  It produces binary data in pcap(3) format.  This utility is
similar to tcpdump(1), but has a number of features tailored to DNS
transactions and protocol options.

OARC likes to use dnscap for DITL data collections.  Some of its
features include:

+ Understands both IPv4 and IPv6
+ Captures UDP, TCP, and IP fragments.
+ Collect only queries, responses, or both (-s option)
+ Collect for only certain source/destination addresses (-a -z -A -Z
  options)
+ Periodically creates new pcap files (-t option)
+ Spawns an upload script after closing a pcap file (-k option)
+ Will start and stop collecting at specific times (-B -E options)
