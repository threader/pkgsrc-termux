Please note that the
${SECCGIDIR}
directory and its contents had most of their permissions removed for security
reasons. Check what the scripts do and enable those that are useful to you
and of acceptable security impact.

Please also note that anything beyond the xymon front page (eg cpu reports,
which contain top output) are a privacy concern and also a potential
excessive information disclosure concern, so you may want to restrict
access to authenticated users.

If you are updating from an earlier version of xymon, many config files
and the directory names have changed.  Refer to
${EXAMPLEDIR}/www/help/upgrade-to-430.txt
for the necessary changes.
