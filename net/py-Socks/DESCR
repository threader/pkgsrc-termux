This package contains an updated and actively maintained version
of SocksiPy, with bug fixes and extra features.

It acts as a drop-in replacement to the socket module.

Features

* SOCKS proxy client for Python 2.6 - 3.x
* TCP and UDP both supported
* HTTP proxy client included but not supported or recommended (you
  should use urllib2's or requests' own HTTP proxy interface)
