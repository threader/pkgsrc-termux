Drill is a tool ala dig from BIND. It was designed with DNSSEC in
mind and should be a useful debugging/query tool for DNSSEC.

A lot of DNS debugging is done with dig, but as dig is made with
the same libraries as BIND8/9 (the most used DNS server out there),
what are you actually debugging/testing? Drill has nothing in common
with either NSD nor BIND. During the development process we are
actually uncovering obscure bugs in NSD and BIND (and in drill
itself).
