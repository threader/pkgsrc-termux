Net_LDAP2 is the successor of Net_LDAP which is a clone of Perls Net::LDAP
object interface to directory servers. It does contain most of Net::LDAPs
features but has some own too.

With Net_LDAP2 you have:
* A simple object-oriented interface to connections, searches entries and
  filters.
* Support for tls and ldap v3.
* Simple modification, deletion and creation of ldap entries.
* Support for schema handling.

Net_LDAP2 layers itself on top of PHP's existing ldap extensions
