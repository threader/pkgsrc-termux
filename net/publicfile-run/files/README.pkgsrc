 Getting help
 ============

You've installed an automated and customized publicfile-run package.
If you're having trouble getting the publicfile daemons to run, ask
the package's maintainer:

<URL:mailto:jlmuir@imca-cat.org>

If you need to ask for help on the publicfile list, please mention that
you're using the publicfile-run package from pkgsrc.
