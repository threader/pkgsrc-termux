Version 20120726 and later include support for SIGHUP to reload settings
with some limitations:
- The parameters other than PG, IG, and LU are not reloaded by SIGHUP.
- PG and IG mapped to LU can't be deleted by SIGHUP.
- If you delete an active LU, all connections of the LU are closed by
  SIGHUP.
- Can't modify LU by SIGHUP.
- Updating IG is not affected until the next login.
