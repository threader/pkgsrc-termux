The wpa_supplicant package provides a wireless client daemon that supports
WPA, WPA2 (IEEE 802.11i / RSN), and WEP.  It implements key
negotiation with a WPA Authenticator and it controls the roaming
and IEEE 802.11 authentication/association of the wlan driver.  It
supports several EAP authentication methods.

This package also includes the wpa_cli console frontend.
