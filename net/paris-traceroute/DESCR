Paris Traceroute is a new version of the well-known network diagnosis and
measurement tool.

traceroute fails in the presence of routers that employ load balancing on
packet header fields. The failures lead to the discovery of inaccurate and
incomplete paths, that may mislead operators during problem diagnosis and
result in erroneous internet maps.

Paris traceroute, by controling packet header contents, obtains a more precise
picture of the actual routes that packets follow.
