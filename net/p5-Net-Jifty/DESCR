Jifty is a full-stack web framework. It provides an optional REST
interface for applications. Using this module, you can interact with
that REST interface to write client-side utilities.  You can use this
module directly, but you'll be better off subclassing it, such as what
we've done for Net::Hiveminder.  This module also provides a number of
convenient methods for writing short scripts.
