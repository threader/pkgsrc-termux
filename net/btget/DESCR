LibBT is a C reimplementation of the BitTorrent core protocols.  Our
goal for the project is to develop a low-overhead library version of
the protocols so that BitTorrent transfers can easily be built into
any existing application.

A supplied application called `btget' is a full fledged BitTorrent
application based on this library.
