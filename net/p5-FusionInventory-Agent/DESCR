The FusionInventory agent is a generic management agent. It can perform a
certain number of tasks, according to its own execution plan, or on behalf of a
GLPI server with fusioninventory plugin, acting as a control point.

Two of these tasks are included in agent source distribution, local inventory
and wake on lan. Other tasks are distributed separatly, excepted for binary
distributions where they are bundled together.
