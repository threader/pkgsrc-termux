Boto is a Python package that provides interfaces to Amazon Web Services.
At the moment, boto supports S3 (Simple Storage Service) and SQS (Simple
Queue Service) via the REST API's provided by those services and EC2
(Elastic Compute Cloud) via the Query API.  The intent is to support
additional services in the future.

The goal of boto is to provide a very simple, easy to use, lightweight
wrapper around the Amazon services.  Not all features supported by the
Amazon Web Services will be supported in boto.  Basically, those
features I need to do what I want to do are supported first.  Other
features and requests are welcome and will be accomodated to the best
of my ability.  Patches and contributions are welcome!
