amq-client is a fully-featured, low-level AMQP 0.9.1 client that runs on Ruby
1.8.7, 1.9.2, REE, Rubinius and JRuby.
It's sweet spot is in serving as foundation for higher-level, more opinionated
AMQP libraries.
It can be used directly by applications code when performance and access to
advanced AMQP protocol features is more important that API convenience.
