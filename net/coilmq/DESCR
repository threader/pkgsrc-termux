CoilMQ is a simple, configurable STOMP message broker (aka STOMP server)
written in Python. This project is inspired by the simple design of the Ruby
stompserver project by Patrick Hurley and Lionel Bouton. The goal of this
project is to provide a well-tested and well-documented Python implementation
with a good set of built-in functionality and numerous paths for extensibility.
