cacti-spine is now installed.

You must perform the following steps to make your Cacti installation
aware of it :

1/ Login to Cacti as an admin user.
2/ "Select Settings" on the menu and click the "Paths" tab.
3/ Enter the *complete* path to your Spine binary in
the "Spine Poller File" Path field and click "Save".
4/ Click the "Poller" tab.
5/ Choose "spine" from the "Poller Type" dropdown box and click "Save".

After completing these steps, Cacti will spawn Spine every 5 minutes
instead of cmd.php. If you are having problems getting Spine to gather
data, you can always temporarily change Poller Type back to "cmd.php".
