ntopng is the next generation version of the original ntop, a network traffic
probe that shows the network usage, similar to what the popular top Unix
command does. ntopng is based on libpcap and it has been written in a portable
way in order to virtually run on every Unix platform, MacOSX and on Windows as
well.

ntopng users can use a a web browser to navigate through ntop (that acts as
a web server) traffic information and get a dump of the network status. In
the latter case, ntopng can be seen as a simple RMON-like agent with
an embedded web interface. The use of:

* a web interface.
* limited configuration and administration via the web interface.
* reduced CPU and memory usage (they vary according to network size and traffic)
