For users migrating from Netatalk 2.x, version 3.x comes with
substantial changes, like an all-new config file format, and the loss
of AppleTalk (ddp) support. You are advised to familiarize yourself
with the changes in advance; use
<http://netatalk.sourceforge.net/3.0/htmldocs/upgrade.html> as a
starting point.

In addition, 3.x appears to only work reliably with the Berkeley
Database v5, so you either have to manually upgrade the existing
CNID database(s), or discard them.
