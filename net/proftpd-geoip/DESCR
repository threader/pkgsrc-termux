The ProFTPD mod_geoip module allows sites to quickly look up geolocation
information such as country, continent, region, timezone, etc based on
the connecting client's IP address. This information can be logged for
tracking purposes, and used to configure access controls in order to
reduce/prevent connections from locations unauthorized by site policy.
