OpenNTPD is a FREE, easy to use implementation of the Network Time Protocol. It
provides the ability to sync the local clock to remote NTP servers and can act
as NTP server itself, redistributing the local clock.

OpenNTPD was primarily developed by Henning Brauer as part of the OpenBSD
Project and gets released as a base component of OpenBSD every six months.

The portable version is maintained by Brent Cook and is mirrored on Github and
available as periodic tarball releases. Contributions are welcome to both the
OpenNTPD core and the portable build framework.

The software is freely usable and re-usable by everyone under a BSD license.
The OpenBSD project sells CDs, T-Shirts and Posters. Sales of these items help
to fund development.
