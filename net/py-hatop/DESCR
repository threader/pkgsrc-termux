HATop is an interactive ncurses client and real-time monitoring, statistics
displaying tool for the HAProxy TCP/HTTP load balancer.

HATop's appearance is similar to top(1). It supports various modes for detailed
statistics of all configured proxies and services in near realtime. In addition,
it features an interactive CLI for the haproxy unix socket. This allows
administrators to control the given haproxy instance (change server weight, put
servers into maintenance mode, ...) directly out of hatop (using keybinds or
the CLI) and monitor the results immediately.

HATop is written in pure Python and has no external dependencies.
