This is the fork of original "Grive" (https://github.com/Grive/grive)
Google Drive client with the support for the new Drive REST API
and partial sync.

Grive can be considered still beta or pre-beta quality. It simply
downloads all the files in your Google Drive into the current
directory. After you make some changes to the local files, run
grive again and it will upload your changes back to your Google
Drive. New files created locally or in Google Drive will be uploaded
or downloaded respectively. Deleted files will also be "removed".
Currently Grive will NOT destroy any of your files: it will only
move the files to a directory named .trash or put them in the Google
Drive trash. You can always recover them.
