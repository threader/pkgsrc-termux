ActiveMQ Apollo is a faster, more reliable, easier to maintain messaging broker
built from the foundations of the original ActiveMQ. It accomplishes this using
a radically different threading and message dispatching architecture.
In it's current incarnation, Apollo only supports the STOMP protocol but just
like the original ActiveMQ, it's been designed to be a multi protocol broker.
In future versions it will be adding OpenWire support so it can be compatible
with ActiveMQ 5.x JMS clients.
