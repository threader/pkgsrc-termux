SNMPTT (SNMP Trap Translator) is an SNMP trap handler written in Perl for
use with the Net-SNMP / UCD-SNMP snmptrapd program (www.net-snmp.org).
SNMPTT supports Linux, Unix and Windows.

Snmptt can log to any of the following destinations: text log, syslog,
NT Event log or a SQL database. External programs can also be run to pass
the translated trap to an email client, paging software, Nagios etc.

In addition to variable substitution, SNMPTT allows complex configurations
allowing:

    * the ability to accept or reject a trap based on the host name,
      ip address, network range, or variable values inside of the trap
      enterprise variables
    * execute external programs to send pages, emails etc
    * perform regular expression search and replace on the translated message
      such as translating the variable value "Building alarm 4" to
      "Moisture detection alarm"
