Netatalk 3 is a freely-available implementation of the Apple
Filesharing Protocol Suite (AFP) over TCP/IP.

Using Netatalk's AFP 3.1 compliant file-server leads to significantly
higher transmissions speeds compared with Macs accessing a server via
SMB or NFS, while providing clients with the best user experience (full
support for Macintosh metadata, flawlessly supporting mixed
environments of classic MacOS and MacOS X clients).
