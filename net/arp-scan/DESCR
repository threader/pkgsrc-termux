arp-scan is a command-line tool for system discovery and fingerprinting.
It constructs and sends ARP requests to the specified IP addresses,
and displays any responses that are received.

arp-scan allows you to:

  * Send ARP packets to any number of destination hosts, using a
  configurable output bandwidth or packet rate.

  * Construct the outgoing ARP packet in a flexible way.

  * Decode and display any returned packets.

  * Fingerprint IP hosts using the arp-fingerprint tool.
