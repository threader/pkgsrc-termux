QUIC is an experimental protocol aimed at reducing web latency over
that of TCP.  On the surface, QUIC is very similar to TCP+TLS+SPDY
implemented on UDP.  Because TCP is implement in operating system
kernels, and middlebox firmware, making significant changes to TCP is
next to impossible.  However, since QUIC is built on top of UDP, it
suffers from no such limitations.

Key features of QUIC over existing TCP+TLS+SPDY include

+ Dramatically reduced connection establishment time
+ Improved congestion control
+ Multiplexing without head of line blocking
+ Forward error correction
+ Connection migration
