Celery is an asynchronous task queue/job queue based on distributed message
passing. It is focused on real-time operation, but supports scheduling as well.

The execution units, called tasks, are executed concurrently on a single or more
worker servers using multiprocessing, Eventlet, or gevent. Tasks can execute
asynchronously (in the background) or synchronously (wait until ready).
