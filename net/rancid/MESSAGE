Please read the included README (${PREFIX}/share/doc/rancid/README) file,
for more information about configuring and starting rancid.

If upgrading from a non-pkgsrc version of rancid, following the instructions
in ${PREFIX}/share/rancid/UPGRADING for retaining your existing CVS
respository and rancid configuration.

NOTE WELL: The router.db field separator has been changed to ';' from ':'
