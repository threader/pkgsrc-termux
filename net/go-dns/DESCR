Complete and usable DNS library. All widely used Resource Records are
supported, including the DNSSEC types. It follows a lean and mean philosophy.
If there is stuff you should know as a DNS programmer there isn't a convenience
function for it. Server side and client side programming is supported, i.e. you
can build servers and resolvers with it.
