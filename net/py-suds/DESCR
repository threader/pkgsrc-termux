The Suds web services client is a lightweight soap-based client for python the
is licensed under LGPL. Basic features:
* No class generation
* Provides an object-like API.
* Reads wsdl at runtime for encoding/decoding
* Provides for the following SOAP (style) binding/encoding:
	- Document/Literal
	- RPC/Literal
	- RPC/Encoded (section 5)

The goal of suds is to present an RPC-like interface into soap-based web
services. This means that in most cases, users do not need to be concerned with
the complexities of the WSDL and referenced schemas. Regardless of which soap
message style is specified, the signature of the service methods remain the
same. Uses that do examine the WSDL will notice that even with the document
soap message style, the signature of each method resembles an RPC. The method
signature contains the contents of the document defined for the message instead
of the document itself.
