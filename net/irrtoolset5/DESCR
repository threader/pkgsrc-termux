IRRToolSet is a suite of policy analysis tools to operate with
routing policies in RPSL [RFC 2622] format, registered in an
Internet Routing Registry(IRR). The main goal of the project is
to make routing information more convenient and useful for
network engineers, by providing tools for automated router configuration,
routing policies analysis, and maintenance.

This package contains the programs rtconfig, peval and rpslcheck.

IRRToolSet started life as RAToolSet from ISI.edu, was then kept by RIPE NCC
for a while, and is currently maintained at ISC.

THIS IS A DEVELOPMENT VERSION (although a release candidate).
