/etc/resolv.conf is a file that holds the configuration for the local
resolution of domain names. Normally this file is either static or maintained
by a local daemon, normally a DHCP daemon. But what happens if more than one
thing wants to control the file? Say you have wired and wireless interfaces to
different subnets and run a VPN or two on top of that, how do you say which one
controls the file? It's also not as easy as just adding and removing the
nameservers each client knows about as different clients could add the same
nameservers.

Enter resolvconf, the middleman between the network configuration services and
/etc/resolv.conf. resolvconf itself is just a script that stores, removes and
lists a full resolv.conf generated for the interface. It then calls all the
helper scripts it knows about so it can configure the real /etc/resolv.conf
and optionally any local nameservers other can libc.
