Inadyn is a small and simple DDNS client with HTTPS support.  That is, it
maintains the IP address of a host name.  It periodically checks whether
the IP address stored by the DNS server is the real current address of the
machine that is running Inadyn.

   Features:
     * supports the many dynamic DNS services, including DynDNS,
       FreeDNS, ZoneEdit, No-IP, and easyDNS.
     * maintains multiple aliases of the same IP address
     * updates the correct IP address even behind a NAT router
     * supports access via http proxy
     * does not perform unnecessary updates
