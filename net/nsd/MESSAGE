The old NSD3 config file can be used without changes for NSD4.  There are
new config statements and some old statements are gone.

The nsd.db file has a new format that allows read and write.  Thus the
nsd.db file needs to be re-created in NSD4 format.  This happens when
you start NSD4.  NSD4 needs write permission on the nsd.db directory
for that.  If you need to rollback to NSD3, run its zonec to recreate
the NSD3 nsd.db file (use nsdc rebuild).

The cron job for nsdc patch is no longer needed.  It can be removed.

If you admire cron jobs, you can have a cron job that does "nsd-control
write".  This would periodically write the contents of changed zones to
their zonefile.

nsdc is removed, reload with kill -HUP $pid and use nsd-control.
The SIGHUP makes NSD4 check zone file timestamps and reload changed zones.
nsd-control reload is the same.  SIGTERM stops NSD.

You probably want to install and enable some of the new NSD 4 features,
such as set up nsd-control and statistics.  And you may want to use the
new pattern config options.
