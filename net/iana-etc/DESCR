This package installs nothing but creates a "protocols" and "services"
file in it's work area. It uses Seth W. Klein's iana-etc software, but
since this has not been modified since 2008, I have updated it to handle
the location and the format of the current files. You can use the protocols
and services files it generates for NetBSD following the information in
/usr/src/doc/3RDPARTY
