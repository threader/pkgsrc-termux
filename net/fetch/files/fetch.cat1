     The ffeettcchh utility provides a command-line interface to the fetch(3)
     library.  Its purpose is to retrieve the file(s) pointed to by the URL(s)
     on the command line.

     The following options are available:

     --11          Stop and return exit code 0 at the first successfully
                 retrieved file.

     --44          Forces ffeettcchh to use IPv4 addresses only.

     --66          Forces ffeettcchh to use IPv6 addresses only.

     --AA          Do not automatically follow ``temporary'' (302) redirects.
                 Some broken Web sites will return a redirect instead of a
                 not-found error when the requested object does not exist.

     --aa          Automatically retry the transfer upon soft failures.

     --BB _b_y_t_e_s    Specify the read buffer size in bytes.  The default is 4096
                 bytes.  Attempts to set a buffer size lower than this will be
                 silently ignored.  The number of reads actually performed is
                 reported at verbosity level two or higher (see the --vv flag).

     --dd          Use a direct connection even if a proxy is configured.

     --FF          In combination with the --rr flag, forces a restart even if the
                 local and remote files have different modification times.
                 Implies --RR.

     --ii          Only fetch if it the output file is older than the referenced
                 URL.  This option is overriden by --oo _-.

     --ll          If the target is a file-scheme URL, make a symbolic link to
                 the target rather than trying to copy it.

     --MM

     --mm          Mirror mode: if the file already exists locally and has the
                 same size and modification time as the remote file, it will
                 not be fetched.  Note that the --mm and --rr flags are mutually
                 exclusive.

     --NN _f_i_l_e     Use _f_i_l_e instead of _~_/_._n_e_t_r_c to look up login names and pass-
                 words for FTP sites.  See ftp(1) for a description of the
                 file format.  This feature is experimental.

     --nn          Do not preserve the modification time of the transferred
                 file.

     --oo _f_i_l_e     Set the output file name to _f_i_l_e.  By default, a ``pathname''
                 is extracted from the specified URI, and its basename is used
                 as the name of the output file.  A _f_i_l_e argument of `-' indi-
                 cates that results are to be directed to the standard output.
                 If the _f_i_l_e argument is a directory, fetched file(s) will be
                 placed within the directory, with name(s) selected as in the
                 default behaviour.

     --qq          Quiet mode.

     --RR          The output files are precious, and should not be deleted
                 under any circumstances, even if the transfer failed or was
                 incomplete.

     --rr          Restart a previously interrupted transfer.  Note that the --mm
                 and --rr flags are mutually exclusive.

     --SS _b_y_t_e_s    Require the file size reported by the server to match the
                 specified value.  If it does not, a message is printed and
                 the file is not fetched.  If the server does not support
                 reporting file sizes, this option is ignored and the file is
                 fetched unconditionally.

     --ss          Print the size in bytes of each requested file, without
                 fetching it.

     --TT _s_e_c_o_n_d_s  Set timeout value to _s_e_c_o_n_d_s.  Overrides the environment
                 variables FTP_TIMEOUT for FTP transfers or HTTP_TIMEOUT for
                 HTTP transfers if set.

     --UU          When using passive FTP, allocate the port for the data con-
                 nection from the low (default) port range.  See ip(4) for
                 details on how to specify which port range this corresponds
                 to.

     --vv          Increase verbosity level.

     --ww _s_e_c_o_n_d_s  When the --aa flag is specified, wait this many seconds between
                 successive retries.

     If ffeettcchh receives a SIGINFO signal (see the ssttaattuuss argument for stty(1)),
     the current transfer rate statistics will be written to the standard
     error output, in the same format as the standard completion message.

EEXXIITT SSTTAATTUUSS
     The ffeettcchh command returns zero on success, or one on failure.  If multi-
     ple URLs are listed on the command line, ffeettcchh will attempt to retrieve
     each one of them in turn, and will return zero only if they were all suc-
     cessfully retrieved.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
     FTP_TIMEOUT   Maximum time, in seconds, to wait before aborting an FTP
                   connection.

     HTTP_TIMEOUT  Maximum time, in seconds, to wait before aborting an HTTP
                   connection.

HHIISSTTOORRYY
     The ffeettcchh command appeared in FreeBSD 2.1.5.  This implementation first
     appeared in FreeBSD 4.1.

AAUUTTHHOORRSS
     The original implementation of ffeettcchh was done by Jean-Marc Zucconi
     <jmz@FreeBSD.org>.  It was extensively re-worked for FreeBSD 2.2 by
     Garrett Wollman <wollman@FreeBSD.org>, and later completely rewritten to
     use the fetch(3) library by Dag-Erling Sm/orgrav <des@FreeBSD.org>.

NNOOTTEESS
     The --bb and --tt options are no longer supported and will generate warnings.
     They were workarounds for bugs in other OSes which this implementation
     does not trigger.

     One cannot both use the --hh, --cc, and --ff options and specify URLs on the
     command line.
