Enhanced CTorrent is a BitTorrent console client written in C/C++. Like
ctorrent, which it is based on, high performance with minimal system
resources and dependencies is a priority. Enhanced CTorrent adds additional
features like dynamic adjustments and fixes several bugs in the original
ctorrent client (obsolete and marked EOL in pkgsrc repository).
