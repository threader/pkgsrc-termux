Guacamole is an HTML5 web application that provides access to desktop
environments using remote desktop protocols (such as VNC or RDP).  Guacamole
is also the project that produces this web application, and provides an API
that drives it.  This API can be used to power other similar applications or
services.

As an API, Guacamole provides a common and efficient means of streaming text
data over a JavaScript-based tunnel using either HTTP or WebSocket, and a
client implementation which supports the Guacamole protocol and renders the
remote display when combined with a Guacamole protocol stream from the
tunnel.

It provides cross-browser mouse and keyboard events, an XML-driven on-screen
keyboard, and synchronized nestable layers with hardware-accelerated
compositing.
