libdlna aims at being the reference open-source implementation of DLNA (Digital
Living Network Alliance) standards. Its primary goal is to provide DLNA support
to uShare, an embedded DLNA & UPnP A/V Media Server, but it will be used to
build both DLNA servers and players in the long term.

libdlna is written in C and relies on FFMPEG librairies (libavformat and
libavcodec) to handle and demux A/V streams. You still need libupnp to provide
basic UPnP support to your project.

libdlna is based on official DLNA specifications and aims at a providing a
complete respect of the defined standards. Right now, libdlna can be used to
build compliant DLNA Media Servers.
