mimms is a program designed to allow you to download streams using
the MMS protocol and save them to your computer, as opposed to
watching them live. Similar functionality is available in full
media player suites such as Xine, MPlayer, and VLC, but mimms is
quick and easy to use and, for the time being, remains a useful
program.

Originally, mimms was forked directly from the last known version
of mmsclient, which was for years unmaintained. mimms was started
with the following goals:

* Keep a working copy of "mmsclient" (now "mimms") well maintained
* Fix lots of the bugs that were in mmsclient
* Extend the functionality of the program in useful ways

Since the 2.x series, mimms shares no code with mmsclient, and
actually does all of it's MMS operations using libmms, a library
based off of the xine-improved mmsclient code, which is designed
to allow multiple implementations of MMS clients without requiring
a fragmented code base. The mimms 3.x series is implemented entirely
in python, and is freed from the details of the MMS protocol and
architecture dependence, and can focus on usability.
