Flickcurl is a C library for the Flickr API, handling creating the
requests, signing, token management, calling the API, marshalling
request parameters and decoding responses. It uses libcurl to call
the REST web service and libxml2 to manipulate the XML responses.
Flickcurl supports all of the API including the functions for
photo/video uploading, browsing, searching, adding and editing
comments, groups, notes, photosets, categories, activity, blogs,
favorites, places, tags, machine tags, institutions, pandas and
photo/video metadata. It also includes a program flickrdf to turn
photo metadata, tags, machine tags and places into an RDF triples
description.
