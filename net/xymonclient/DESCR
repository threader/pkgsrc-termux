Xymon is the successor to (rename of) Hobbit which was the successor
to the bbgen toolkit, which had been available as an add-on to Big Brother
since late 2002.

Xymon monitors your hosts, your network services, and anything else
you configure it to do via extensions. This is the client (agent) package.
