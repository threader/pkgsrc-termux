For users migrating from Netatalk 1.x, note that CAP encoding is not
supported by Netatalk 2 any more. There are tools to convert CAP
encoded file names to UTF-8, but that is not a simple and safe way.

Instead, consider backing up your Netatalk 1.x volumes to a client before
the update, and restoring the backups from the client to the Netatalk 2
server.
