  access.
* Includes support for multiples profiles, AV profile (RFC3551) being the
  one by default.
* Includes a packet scheduler for to send and recv packet "on time",
  according to their timestamp. Scheduling is optional, rtp sessions can
  remain not scheduled.
* Supports mutiplexing IO, so that hundreds of RTP sessions can be scheduled
  by a single thread.
* Features an adaptive jitter algorithm for a receiver to adapt to the
  clockrate of the sender.
* Supports part of RFC2833 for telephone events over RTP.
* The API is well documented using gtk-doc.
