cacti is now installed.

To get cacti up and running asap, you have to complete these steps:

- Install & Configure MySQL database server.

- Add a cacti database and cactiuser user to MySQL and create the cacti
  database layout (${CACTIDIR}/cacti.sql) to MySQL:

	mysql> CREATE DATABASE cacti;
	mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON cacti.* TO 'cactiuser'@'localhost'
	    -> IDENTIFIED BY 'cactiuser';
        mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
        mysql> USE cacti;
        mysql> SOURCE ${CACTIDIR}/cacti.sql;

- Install & Configure an Apache webserver.

- If you have not already done so, add these lines to enable php extensions
  required by cacti in ${PKG_SYSCONFBASE}/etc/php.ini

	extension=mysql.so
	extension=snmp.so
	extension=sockets.so

- Append this to Apache webserver's "httpd.conf" and restart the server.

	Include etc/httpd/httpd-cacti.conf

- Add the following lines to ${CACTI_USER}'s crontab

# Invoke poller.php to collect SNMP statistics.
*/5 * * * *	${PREFIX}/bin/cacti-poller

  and make sure ${PREFIX}/bin is in PATH.

Please read the included README (${CACTIDIR}/docs/README) file,
for more information about configuring and starting cacti.

If you have updated from a version older than 0.8.8h, note that the
rrd and log directories are now under ${VARBASE}. Old logs and
database files need to be moved manually, and you have to update the
log path in "Console:Settings:Paths:Logging".
