To use pure-ftpd, you will need to perform the following steps:

1. In case you don't have PKG_RCD_SCRIPTS set in your /etc/mk.conf, copy
   ${PREFIX}/${RCD_SCRIPTS_EXAMPLEDIR}/pure_ftpd to /etc/rc.d/pure_ftpd and add

	pure_ftpd=YES
	pure_ftpd_flags="<any pure-ftpd flags>"

   to /etc/rc.conf. Other FTP servers should be disabled.

2. Stop any other running FTP server. Now start pure-ftpd by issuing the
   command

	/etc/rc.d/pure_ftpd start

3. If you want to use pure-uploadscript, you should copy pure_uploadscript to
   /etc/rc.d, if you don't have it already, and need to add "-o" option to
   pure_ftpd_flags, and set

	 pure_uploadscript=YES
	 pure_uploadscript_flags="-r /path/to/script"

   Then you can start by

	/etc/rc.d/pure_uploadscript start

   For more details, read pure-uploadscript(8).
