This plugin for the agent provides two tasks that were previously distributed
separatly:

* the NetDiscovery task allows the agent to scan the network to find remote
  devices, through nmap, NetBios or SNMP, and to identify them
* the NetInventory task allows the agent to extract various informations from
  a remote device through SNMP protocol
