The MiniUPnP project offers software which supports the UPnP Internet Gateway
Device (IGD) specifications. Recently, NAT-PMP support was added to
MiniUPnPd. For client side NAT-PMP support, use libnatpmp.

UPnP and NAT-PMP are used to improve internet connectivity for devices behind
a NAT router. Any peer to peer network application such as games, IM, etc.
can benefit from a NAT router supporting UPnP and/or NAT-PMP.

The latest generation Microsoft XBOX 360 and Sony Playstation 3 game machines
use UPnP commands to enable the online play with the XBOX Live service and
the Playstation Network. It has been reported that miniupnpd is correctly
working with the two consoles.
