IO::Socket::INET6 provides an object interface to creating and
using sockets in both AF_INET|AF_INET6 domain. It is built upon
the IO::Socket interface and inherits all the methods defined by
IO::Socket.

WARNING: You should use this module mainly to program IPv6 domain.
Most pobably future releases will not support AF_INET | AF_UNSPEC
options, as the module seems to fail on some given corner cases.
If you require IPv4, you are encouraged to use IO::Socket::INET
from the application level. Be warned.
