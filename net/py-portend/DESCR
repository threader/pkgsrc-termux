Use portend to monitor TCP ports for bound or unbound states.

For example, to wait for a port to be occupied, timing out after 3 seconds::

	portend.occupied('www.pkgsrc.org', 80, timeout=3)

Or to wait for a port to be free, timing out after 5 seconds::

	portend.free('::1', 80, timeout=5)

The portend may also be executed directly. If the function succeeds, it
returns nothing and exits with a status of 0. If it fails, it prints a
message and exits with a status of 1. For example::

	python -m portend localhost:31923 free
	(exits immediately)

	python -m portend -t 1 localhost:31923 occupied
	(one second passes)
	Port 31923 not bound on localhost.
