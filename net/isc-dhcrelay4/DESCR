ISC's Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Distribution provides a
freely redistributable reference implementation of all aspects of
DHCP, through a suite of DHCP tools:

* A DHCP server
* A DHCP client
* A DHCP relay agent

These tools all use a modular API which is designed to be sufficiently
general that it can easily be made to work on POSIX-compliant
operating systems and also non-POSIX systems like Windows NT and
MacOS.

The DHCP server, client and relay agent are provided both as
reference implementations of the protocol and as working, fully-featured
sample implementations. Both the client and the server provide
functionality that, while not strictly required by the protocol,
is very useful in practice. The DHCP server also makes allowances
for non-compliant clients which one might still like to support.

This package contains the Relay component.
