tamago-tsunagi is Emacs plug-in to bridge inputmethods of (Free)Wnn, Canna,
sj3, and Anthy.  It is fork from IM egg(tamago) and it supports Emacs-24.3
and later, one of successors of editors/tamago.

Similar work may also be found at

	http://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/pkg-anthy/egg.git

but it does not have capability with (Free)Wnn and Canna.
