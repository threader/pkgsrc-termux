A HMM-based(Hidden Markov Model) sentence pinyin input method for Chinese.

This Project starts from my graduate life in BUPT. Evolved from a research
prototype to a real project. This input method is based on scim-pinyin, a
popular Linux input method.

Hopefully this project will help you speed up inputing Chinese characters.
