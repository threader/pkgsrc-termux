Provides an adapter layer between core routines for converting to and from
UTF8 and other encodings.  In essence, a way to give multiple existing
Unicode modules a single common interface so you don't have to know
the underlaying implementations to do simple UTF8 to-from other character
set encoding conversions.  As such, it wraps the Unicode::String,
Unicode::Map8, Unicode::Map and Jcode modules in a standardized and
simple API.

This also provides general character set conversion operation based
on UTF8 - it is possible to convert between any two compatible and
supported character sets via a simple two step chaining of conversions.
