This library implements a deserializer for an efficient, compact-output,
and feature-rich binary protocol called Sereal. Its sister module
Sereal::Encoder implements an encoder for this format. The two are released
separately to allow for independent and safer upgrading.

The Sereal protocol version that is compatible with this decoder
implementation is currently protocol version 1. As it stands, it will
refuse to attempt to decode future versions of the protocol, but there
is likely going to be an option to decode the parts of the input that
are compatible with version 1 of the protocol. The protocol was designed
to allow for this.
