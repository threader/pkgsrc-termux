This library implements an efficient, compact-output, and feature-rich
serializer using a binary protocol called Sereal. Its sister module
Sereal::Decoder implements a decoder for this format. The two are released
separately to allow for independent and safer upgrading.

The Sereal protocol version emitted by this encoder implementation is
currently protocol version 1.
