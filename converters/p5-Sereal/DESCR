This is an experimental module. Before using it in production, please get
in touch with the authors!

Sereal is an efficient, compact-output, binary and feature-rich
serialization protocol. The Perl encoder is implemented as the
Sereal::Encoder module, the Perl decoder correspondingly as
Sereal::Decoder. They are distributed separately to allow for safe
upgrading without downtime. (Hint: Upgrade the decoder everywhere first,
then the encoder.)

This Sereal module is a very thin wrapper around both Sereal::Encoder and
Sereal::Decoder. It depends on both and loads both. So if you have a user
of both encoder and decoder, it is enough to depend on a particular version
of Sereal and you'll get the most recent released versions of
Sereal::Encoder and Sereal::Decoder whose version is smaller than or equal
to the version of Sereal you depend on.

The protocol specification and many other bits of documentation can be
found in the github repository. Right now, the specification is at
   https://github.com/Sereal/Sereal/blob/master/sereal_spec.pod, there is a
discussion of the design objectives in
   https://github.com/Sereal/Sereal/blob/master/README.pod, and the output of
our benchmarks can be seen at
https://github.com/Sereal/Sereal/wiki/Sereal-Comparison-Graphs.
