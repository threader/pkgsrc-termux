This module contains an interface to the GNU Recode library. The GNU Recode
library converts files between various coded character sets and surface
encodings. When this cannot be achieved exactly, it may get rid of the
offending characters or fall back on approximations. The library recognises or
produces nearly 150 different character sets and is able to convert files
between almost any pair. Most RFC 1345 character sets are supported.
