A homoglyph is one of two or more graphemes, characters, or glyphs with shapes
that appear identical or very similar wikipedia:Homoglyph

AlaskaJazz, might be upset to be impersonated by a trickster who deliberately
chose the username AlaskaJazz.

* AlaskaJazz is single script: only Latin characters.
* AlaskaJazz is mixed-script: the first character is a greek letter.
