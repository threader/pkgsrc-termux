This module converts strings from and to 2-byte Unicode UCS2 format. All
mappings happen via 2 byte UTF16 encodings, not via 1 byte UTF8 encoding.
To transform these use Unicode::String.

This module can't deal directly with utf8. Use Unicode::String to convert
utf8 to utf16 and vice versa.

Character mapping is according to the data of binary mapfiles in
Unicode::Map hierarchy. Binary mapfiles can also be created with this module,
enabling you to install own specific character sets.
