PHP classes to provide Unicode Normalization.

Performs the 4 normalizations:

	NFD: Canonical Decomposition
	NFC: Canonical Decomposition, followed by Canonical Composition
	NFKD: Compatibility Decomposition
	NFKC: Compatibility Decomposition, followed by Canonical Composition

Complies with the official Unicode.org regression test.  Uses UTF8 binary
strings natively but can normalize a string in any UTF format.  Fully tested
with phpUnit. Code coverage test close to 100%.
