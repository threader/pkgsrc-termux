Unicode::Collate implements Unicode Collation Algorithm (UCA). The UCA
provides a specification for how to compare two Unicode strings while
remaining conformant to the requirements of The Unicode Standard. The UCA
also supplies the Default Unicode Collation Element Table (DUCET), which
is data specifying the default collation order for all Unicode characters.
