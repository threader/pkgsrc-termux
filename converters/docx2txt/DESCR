docx2txt (http://docx2txt.sourceforge.net/) is a simple tool to
generate equivalent text files from Microsoft .docx documents, with
an attempt towards preserving sufficient formatting and document
information, and appropriate character conversions for a good text
experience.

PKGSRC NOTE: contrary to the original package, pkgsrc only installs the
perl script, and without the suffix .pl
