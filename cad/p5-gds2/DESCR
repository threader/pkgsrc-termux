This is GDS2, a module for creating programs to read,
write, and manipulate GDS2 (GDSII) stream files.

GDS2 should be able to handle any size gdsii file but
I would consider it too slow for anything larger
than a few megabytes in size. If your files are are
closer to the gigabyte range please check out my
gdt programs at: http://sourceforge.net/projects/gds2/
which you can use to open and process GDS2 files
as a pipe from Perl.
