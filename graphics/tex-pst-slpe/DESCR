This PStricks package covers all the colour gradient functionality of
pst-grad (part of the base pstricks distribution), and provides the
following facilities: - it permits the user to specify an arbitrary
number of colours, along with the points at which they are to be
reached; - it converts between RGB and HSV behind the scenes; - it
provides concentric and radial gradients; - it provides a command
\psBall that generates bullets with a three-dimensional appearance; and
- uses the xkeyval package for the extended key handling.
