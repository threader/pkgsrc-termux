TeXdraw is a set of macro definitions for TeX, which allow the
user to produce PostScript drawings from within TeX and LaTeX.
TeXdraw has been designed to be extensible. Drawing 'segments'
are relocatable, self-contained units. Using a combination of
the TeX's grouping mechanism and the gsave/grestore mechanism
in PostScript, drawing segments allow for local changes to the
scaling and line parameters. Using TeX's macro definition
capability, new drawing commands can be constructed from
drawing segments.
