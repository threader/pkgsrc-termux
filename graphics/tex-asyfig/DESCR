The package provides a means of reading Asymptote figures from separate
files, rather than within the document, as is standard in the asymptote
package, which is provided as part of the Asymptote bundle. The
asymptote way can prove cumbersome in a large document; the present
package allows the user to process one picture at a time, in simple test
documents, and then to migrate (with no fuss) to their use in the target
document.
