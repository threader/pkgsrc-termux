The capabilities of the Color library are limited to pure mathematical
manipulation of the colors based on color theory without reference to
color profiles (such as sRGB or Adobe RGB).  For most purposes, when
working with the RGB and HSL colors, this won't matter.  However, some
color models (like CIE La*b) are not supported because Color does not
yet support color profiles, giving no meaningful way to convert colors
in absolute color spaces (like La*b, XYZ) to non-absolute color spaces
(like RGB).
