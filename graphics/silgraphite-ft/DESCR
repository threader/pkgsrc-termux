Graphite is a smart font engine that basically takes a unicode string
and font formatting information (features, size, etc.) and returns a
set of positioned glyphs.  In reality, Graphite does more than this in
that it handles cursor tracking and interaction with the rendering
engine for string selection, etc.

This package is a wrapper for FreeType.
