The (so called) "Security Images" are so popular. Most internet
software use these in their registration screens to block robot
programs (which may register tons of fake member accounts). Security
images are basicaly, graphical CAPTCHAs (Completely Automated Public
Turing Test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart). This module gives
you a basic interface to create such an image. The final output is
the actual graphic data, the mime type of the graphic and the
created random string. The module also has some "styles" that are
used to create the background (or foreground) of the image.

If you are an Authen::Captcha user, see GD::SecurityImage::AC for
migration from Authen::Captcha to GD::SecurityImage.

This module is just an image generator. Not a captcha handler. The
validation of the generated graphic is left to your programming
taste. But there are some captcha handlers for several Perl
FrameWorks. If you are an user of one of these frameworks, see
"GD::SecurityImage Implementations" in "SEE ALSO" section for
information.
