This framework provides additional image format plugins for QtGui.  As
such it is not required for the compilation of any other software, but
may be a runtime requirement for Qt-based software to support certain
image formats.

The following image formats have read-only support:

- Gimp (xcf)
- OpenEXR (exr)
- Photoshop documents (psd)
- Sun Raster (ras)

The following image formats have read and write support:

- Encapsulated PostScript (eps)
- Personal Computer Exchange (pcx)
- SGI images (rgb, rgba, sgi, bw)
- Softimage PIC (pic)
- Targa (tga): supports more formats than Qt's version
- XView (xv)
