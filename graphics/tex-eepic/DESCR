Extensions to epic and the LaTeX picture drawing environment, include
the drawing of lines at any slope, the drawing of circles in any radii,
and the drawing of dotted and dashed lines much faster with much less
TeX memory, and providing several new commands for drawing ellipses,
arcs, splines, and filled circles and ellipses. The package uses tpic
\special commands.
