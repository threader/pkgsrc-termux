The package offers a collection of macros for MetaPost to make
easier to draw finite-state machines, automata, labelled
graphs, etc. The user defines nodes, which may be isolated or
arranged into matrices or trees; edges connect pairs of nodes
through arbitrary paths. Parameters, that specify the shapes of
nodes and the styles of edges, may be adjusted.
