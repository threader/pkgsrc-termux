The Gnome2::Canvas module allows a perl developer to use the
GnomeCanvas widget with Gtk2-Perl.

Like the Gtk2 module on which it depends, Gnome2::Canvas follows
the C API of libgnomecanvas-2.0 as closely as possible while still
being perlish.  Thus, the C API reference remains the canonical
documentation.
