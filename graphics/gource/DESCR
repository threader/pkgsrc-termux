Software projects are displayed by Gource as an animated tree with
the root directory of the project at its centre. Directories appear
as branches with files as leaves. Developers can be seen working
on the tree at the times they contributed to the project.

Currently Gource includes built-in log generation support for Git,
Mercurial and Bazaar and SVN (as of 0.29). Gource can also parse
logs produced by several third party tools for CVS repositories.
