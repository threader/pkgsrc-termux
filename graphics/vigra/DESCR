VIGRA is a computer vision library that puts its main emphasize on
flexible algorithms, because algorithms represent the principle know-how
of this field. The library was consequently built using generic
programming as introduced by Stepanov and Musser and exemplified in the
C++ Standard Template Library. By writing a few adapters (image iterators
and accessors) you can use VIGRA's algorithms on top of your data
structures, within your environment. Alternatively, you can also use the
data structures provided within VIGRA, which can be easily adapted to a
wide range of applications. VIGRA's flexibility comes almost for free:
Since the design uses compile-time polymorphism (templates), performance
of the compiled program approaches that of a traditional, hand tuned,
inflexible, solution.
