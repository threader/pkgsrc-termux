This PSTricks package provides a really rather simple command
\PstPolygon that will draw various regular and non-regular polygons
(according to command parameters); various shortcuts to commonly-used
polygons are provided, as well as a command \pspolygonbox that frames
text with a polygon. The package uses the xkeyval package for argument
decoding.
