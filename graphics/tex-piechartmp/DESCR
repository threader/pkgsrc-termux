The piechartmp package is an easy way to draw pie-charts with
MetaPost. The package implements an interface that enables
users with little MetaPost experience to draw charts. A
highlight of the package is the possibility of suppressing some
segments of the chart, thus creating the possibility of several
charts from the same data.
