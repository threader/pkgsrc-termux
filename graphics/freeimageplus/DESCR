FreeImage is an Open Source library project for developers who would like to
support popular graphics image formats like PNG, BMP, JPEG, TIFF and others as
needed by today's multimedia applications. FreeImage is easy to use, fast,
multithreading safe, compatible with all 32-bit or 64-bit versions of Windows,
and cross-platform (works both with Linux and Mac OS X).

Thanks to its ANSI C interface, FreeImage is usable in many languages including
C, C++, VB, C#, Delphi, Java and also in common scripting languages such as
Perl, Python, PHP, TCL or Ruby.
