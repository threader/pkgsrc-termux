This module provides a Perl interface to the amazing Graphviz, an open source
graph visualization tool from AT&T.

It is called GraphViz2 so that pre-existing code using (the Perl module)
GraphViz continues to work. GraphViz2 V 1 is not backwards compatible with
GraphViz V 2, despite the considerable similarity.
