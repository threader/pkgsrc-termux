The package provides tools for including graphics at the full
size of the output medium, or for creating "pages" whose size
is that of the graphic they contain. A principal use case is
documents that require inclusion of (potentially many) scans or
photographs. Bookmarking is especially supported. The tool box
has basic macros and a 'convenience' user interface that wraps
\includegraphics.
