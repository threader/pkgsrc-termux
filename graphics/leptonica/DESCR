This package contains well-tested C code for some basic image processing
operations, along with a description of the functions and some design methods.
A full set of affine transformations (translation, shear, rotation, scaling)
on images of all depths is included, with the exception that some of the
scaling methods do not work at all depths. There are also implementations of
binary morphology, grayscale morphology, convolution and rank order filters,
and applications such as jbig2 image processing and color quantization.
