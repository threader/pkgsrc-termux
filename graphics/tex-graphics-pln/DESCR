The Plain TeX graphics package is mostly a thin shell around
the LaTeX graphicx and color packages, with support of the
LaTeX-isms in those packages provided by miniltx (which is the
largest part of the bundle). The bundle also contains a file
"picture.tex", which is a wrapper around the autopict.sty, and
provides the LaTeX picture mode to Plain TeX users.
