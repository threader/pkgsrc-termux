cairocffi is a CFFI-based drop-in replacement for Pycairo, a set of Python
bindings and object-oriented API for Cairo. Cairo is a 2D vector graphics
library with support for multiple backends including image buffers, PNG,
PostScript, PDF, and SVG file output.

Additionally, the cairocffi.pixbuf module uses GDK-PixBuf to decode various
image formats for use in Cairo.
