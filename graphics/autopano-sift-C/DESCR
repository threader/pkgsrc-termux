The SIFT algorithm provides the capability to identify key feature points within
arbitrary images. It further extracts highly distinct information for each
such point and allows to characterize the point invariant to a number of
modifications to the image. It is invariant to contrast/brightness changes, to
rotation, scaling and partially invariant to other kinds of transformations.
The algorithm can be flexibly used to create input data for image matching,
object identification and other computer vision related algorithms.

This package provides an implementation of the SIFT algorithm and a set of
utilities to utilize the algorithm to match two or more images. As output, a
number of control points are created, which specify one and the same image
location in two images.
