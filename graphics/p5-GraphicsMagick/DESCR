This is an objected-oriented Perl interface to GraphicsMagick, a fork of
ImageMagick. It provides an interface similar to that PerlMagick provides
to ImageMagick, but wit a different class name.
Use the module to read, manipulate, or write an image or image sequence from
within a Perl script. This makes it suitable for Web CGI scripts.
