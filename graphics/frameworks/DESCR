Frameworks is stop-motion animation frame capture software primarily for
Linux. Frameworks captures images from a camera and strings them together into
an animation. These still images may then be combined into a single video file
using other software. Only video4linux webcams are currently supported; work
is being done to add other types of digital cameras including IEEE 1394
camcorders, and USB still cameras. Frameworks is designed to be easily used
alongside the GIMP Animation Package (GAP).

Frameworks provides an interface to camera brightness and other controls. It
captures images as frame_0001.png, frame_0002.png, and so on. Frameworks
provides animation assistance in the form of onion skinning: displaying ghost
images of previous frames, and continuous preview: continuous playback of the
most recent few seconds followed by the live view from the camera. No editing
features are provided.
