The feynmf package provides an interface to Metafont (inspired
by the facilities of mfpic) to use simple structure
specifications to produce relatively complex diagrams. (The
feynmp package, also part of this bundle, uses MetaPost in the
same way.) While the package was designed for Feynman diagrams,
it could in principle be used for diagrams in graph and similar
theories, where the structure is semi-algorithmically
determined.
