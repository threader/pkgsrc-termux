Paper is a modern freedesktop icon theme whose design is based around the use
of bold colours and simple geometric shapes to compose icons. Each icon has
been meticulously designed for pixel-perfect viewing.

While it does take some inspiration from the icons in Google's Material Design,
some aspects have been adjusted to better suit a desktop environment.
