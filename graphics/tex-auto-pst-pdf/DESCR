The package uses --shell-escape to execute pst-pdf when
necessary. This makes it especially easy to integrate into the
workflow of an editor with just "LaTeX" and "pdfLaTeX" buttons.
Wrappers are provided for various psfrag-related features so
that Matlab figures via laprint, Mathematica figures via
MathPSfrag, and regular psfrag figures can all be input
consistently and easily.
