Resynthesizer is a Gimp plug-in for texture synthesis. Given a
sample of a texture, it can create more of that texture. This has
a surprising number of uses:

    * Creating more of a texture
      (including creation of tileable textures)

    * Removing objects from images
      (great for touching up photos)

    * Creating themed images
