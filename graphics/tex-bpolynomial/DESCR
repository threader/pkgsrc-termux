This MetaPost package helps plotting polynomial and root
functions up to order three. The package provides macros to
calculate Bezier curves exactly matching a given constant,
linear, quadratic or cubic polynomial, or square or cubic root
function. In addition, tangents on all functions and
derivatives of polynomials can be calculated.
