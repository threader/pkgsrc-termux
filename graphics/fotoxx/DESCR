Fotoxx is a free open source Linux program for editing image files
from a digital camera. The goal of fotoxx is to meet most image
editing needs while remaining easy to use.

Navigate images with a pageable thumbnail window, edit an entire
image or selected areas, change brightness and contrast, flatten
brightness distribution, change color intensity, reduce the number
of colors (posterize), make panoramas, make HDR images, crop, rotate
(any angle), rescale, fix red-eye, fix perspective (slanted
buildings), warp, sharpen, blur, remove noise (speckles), add tags
to images and search by tags, make a collage of images and text,
print.
