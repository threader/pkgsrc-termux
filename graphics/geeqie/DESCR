Geeqie is a lightweight Gtk+ based image viewer for Unix like
operating systems.
Geeqie has been forked from gqview project, because it was not possible
to contact gqview author and the only maintainer. Geeqie projects goal is
to move the development forward and also integrate the existing patches.
