libxmi is a machine-independent vector graphics rasterization library.
libxmi is based on the vector graphics code in the sample X server that is
a part of the X Window System distribution. The code has been converted
to ANSI C, extensively rearranged and commented, and somewhat extended.
(In particular, by adding support for multicolored dashing.)

The core API includes functions for creating, manipulating, and destroying
miPaintSet objects. It also includes functions for creating, manipulating,
and destroying miCanvas objects. The function miCopyPaintedSetToCanvas()
moves the points in a miPaintedSet to the next stage of the graphics
pipeline: it merges them onto a miCanvas. There is support in this second
stage for sophisticated pixel-merging algorithms.
