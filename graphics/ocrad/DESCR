GNU Ocrad is an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) program based on a
feature extraction method. It reads images in pbm (bitmap), pgm
(greyscale) or ppm (color) formats and produces text in byte (8-bit) or
UTF-8 formats.

Also includes a layout analyser able to separate the columns or blocks of
text normally found on printed pages.
