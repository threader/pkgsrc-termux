The package provides a set of macros for naturally typesetting
electrical and (somewhat less naturally, perhaps) electronic
networks. It is designed as a tool that is easy to use, with a
lean syntax, native to LaTeX, and directly supporting PDF
output format. So is based on the very impressive pgf/TikZ
package.
