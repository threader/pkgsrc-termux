Enblend combines images that partially overlap into a single large
image without seams. Enfuse combines images that overlap but have
different lighting or focusing into a single image with good exposure
and good focus. Both programs assume that your images are already
lined up.

To make panoramas with Enblend and/or Enfuse, use Hugin.
