Pst-circ is a package built using PSTricks and in particular pst-node.
It can easily draw current 2-terminal devices and some 3- and 4-terminal
devices used in electronic or electric theory. The package's macros are
designed with a view to 'logical' representation of circuits, as far as
possible, so as to relieve the user of purely graphical considerations
when expressing a circuit.
