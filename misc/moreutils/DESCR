moreutils is a growing collection of the unix tools that nobody
thought to write long ago when unix was young.

It consists of these tools:

 - chronic: runs a command quietly unless it fails
 - combine: combine the lines in two files using boolean operations
 - errno: look up errno names and descriptions
 - ifdata: get network interface info without parsing ifconfig output
 - isutf8: check if a file or standard input is utf-8
 - ifne: run a command if the standard input is not empty
 - lckdo: execute a program with a lock held (deprecated)
 - mispipe: pipe two commands, returning the exit status of the first
 - parallel: run multiple jobs at once
 - pee: tee standard input to pipes
 - sponge: soak up standard input and write to a file
 - ts: timestamp standard input
 - vidir: edit a directory in your text editor
 - vipe: insert a text editor into a pipe
 - zrun: automatically uncompress arguments to command
