Gaupol is an editor for text-based subtitle files. It supports
multiple subtitle file formats and provides means of correcting
texts and timing subtitles to match video. The user interface is
designed with attention to batch processing of multiple documents
and convenience of translating.

Gaupol should run on all Unix-like (GNU/Linux, *BSD, etc.) operating
systems and on Windows. Technically it should be able to run on
Mac as well, but that has not been tested nor made convenient.
Gaupol's user interface is based on the GTK+ toolkit and has been
designed to best fit the GNOME desktop environment.
