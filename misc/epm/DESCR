EPM is an open source UNIX software and file packaging program that
generates distribution archives from a list of files. EPM provides a
complete, cross-platform software distribution solution for your
applications.

ESP generates both native and "portable" script-based distribution packages
complete with installation and removal scripts and standard
install/uninstall GUIs. The installers can be customized with product logos,
"readme" files, and click-wrap licenses as desired.
