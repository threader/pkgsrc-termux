This package provides a common set of SGML entities and XML/CSS style
sheets used in building/formatting the documentation provided in other
X.Org packages.   It's typically only needed by people building from
source who want to produce formatted documentation from their builds,
or those who have installed the HTML version of the documentation,
which refers to the included common xorg.css stylesheet.
