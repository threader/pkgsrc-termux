dvtm brings the concept of tiling window management, popularized by X11-window
managers like dwm, to the console. As a console window manager, it tries to make
it easy to work with multiple console-based programs like vim, mutt, cmus, or
irssi. dvtm is intended to be used where X11 isn't available or over SSH. In
conjunction with dtach, it can be seen as a lightweight alternative to GNU
screen.
