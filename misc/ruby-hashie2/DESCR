Hashie is a growing collection of tools that extend Hashes and make
them more useful. The library is broken up into a number of atomically
includeable Hash extension modules as described below. This provides
maximum flexibility for users to mix and match functionality while
maintaining feature parity with earlier versions of Hashie.

 * Mash is an extended Hash that gives simple pseudo-object
   functionality that can be built from hashes and easily extended.

 * Dash is an extended Hash that has a discrete set of defined
   properties and only those properties may be set on the hash.

 * A Trash is a Dash that allows you to translate keys on
   initialization.

 * Clash is a Chainable Lazy Hash that allows you to easily construct
   complex hashes using method notation chaining

 * Rash is a Hash whose keys can be Regexps or Ranges, which will map
   many input keys to a value.
