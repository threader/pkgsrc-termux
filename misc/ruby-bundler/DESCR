Bundler is a tool that manages gem dependencies for your ruby
application. It takes a gem manifest file and is able to fetch,
download, and install the gems and all child dependencies specified in
this manifest. It can manage any update to the gem manifest file and
update the bundle's gems accordingly. It also lets you run any ruby
code in context of the bundle's gem environment.
