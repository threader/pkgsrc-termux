Parley is a program to help you memorize things.  Parley supports many
language specific features but can be used for other learning tasks just
as well. It uses the spaced repetition learning method, also known as
flash cards.

Creating new vocabulary collections with Parley is easy, but of course it
is even better if you can use some of our premade files. Have a look at
the KDE-Files.org page or use the "Download New Collections" feature
directly in Parley.
