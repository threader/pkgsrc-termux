The Mnemosyne Project has two aspects:

    * It's a sophisticated free flash-card tool which optimizes
    your learning process.
    * It's a research project into the nature of long-term memory.

The Mnemosyne software resembles a traditional flash-card program
to help you memorise question/answer pairs, but with an important
twist: it uses a sophisticated algorithm to schedule the best time
for a card to come up for review. Difficult cards that you tend to
forget quickly will be scheduled more often, while Mnemosyne won't
waste your time on things you remember well.

While you use the software, detailed statistics can be kept on your
learning process. If you want, these logs can be uploaded in a
transparent and anonymous way to a central server for analysis.

This data will be valuable to study the behaviour of our memory
over a very long time period. As an additional benefit, the results
will be used to improve the scheduling algorithms behind the software
even further.
