AnsiWeather is a Shell script for displaying the current weather conditions in
your terminal, with support for ANSI colors and Unicode symbols.

Weather data comes from the `OpenWeatherMap` free weather API.

The default location of a configuration file can be overriden by the global
environment variable ANSIWEATHERRC.

Beware, if configuration file doesn't exists, the script queries a GeoIP API to
try to approximate user location, this service may be overloaded at time so the
application might appear stalled.
