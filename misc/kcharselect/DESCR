KCharSelect is a tool to select special characters from all installed
fonts and copy them into the clipboard.

You can browse characters by their category or quickly find a certain
character by searching for its name. KCharSelect displays various
information about the selected character. This includes not only the
Unicode character name, but also aliases, general notes and cross
references to similar characters. For technical use, different
representations of the character are shown. KCharSelect also contains
Unihan data for East Asian characters to display English definitions
and different pronunciations.
