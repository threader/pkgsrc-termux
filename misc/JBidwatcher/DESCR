A Java-based application allowing you to monitor auctions you're
not part of, submit bids, snipe (bid at the last moment), and
otherwise track your auction-site experience. It includes adult-auction
management, MANY currencies (pound, dollar (US, Canada, Australian,
and New Taiwanese) and euro, presently), drag-and-drop of auction
URLs, an original, unique and powerful 'multisniping' feature, a
relatively nice UI, and is known to work cleanly under Linux,
Windows, Solaris, and MacOSX from the same binary.
