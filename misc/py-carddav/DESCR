pyCardDAV is supposed to provide a simple way of accessing a CardDAV
resource, mainly for use with mutt's query_command, but it might
be of some use solo. pyCardDAV consists of pycardsyncer, a program
for syncing your CardDAV resource into a local database and of
pc_query, a program for querying the local database.
