Tellico is a KDE application for organizing your collections. It
provides default templates for books, bibliographies, videos, music,
video games, coins, stamps, trading cards, comic books, and wines.

Tellico allows you to enter your collection in a catalogue database,
saving many different properties like title, author, etc. Two
different views of your collection are shown. On the left, your
entries are grouped together by any field you like, allowing you
to see how many are in each group. On the right, selected fields
are shown in column format, allowing you to sort by any field. On
the bottom is a customizable HTML view of the current entry. The
entry editor is a dialog box where you enter the data. Check out
the screenshots.

Tellico keeps things simple, so no database server is needed. The
data is saved in XML format, which makes for easy parsing, portability,
and styling.
