This repository contains the generated Go packages for common protocol buffer
types, and the generated gRPC code necessary for interacting with Google's gRPC
APIs.

There are two sources for the proto files used in this repository:

1. google/protobuf: the code in the protobuf and ptypes subdirectories is
   derived from this repo. The messages in protobuf are used to describe
   protocol buffer messages themselves. The messages under ptypes define the
   common well-known types.
2. googleapis/googleapis: the code in the googleapis is derived from this repo.
   The packages here contain types specifically for interacting with Google
   APIs.
