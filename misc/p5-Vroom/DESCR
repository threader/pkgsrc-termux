Ever given a Slide Show and needed to switch over to Vim?
Now you don't ever have to switch again. You're already there.
Vroom lets you create your slides in a single file using a Wiki-like
style, much like Spork and Sporx do. The difference is that your
slides don't compile to HTML or JavaScript or XUL. They get turned
into a set of files that begin with '0', like '03' or '07c' or
'05b.pl'.
The slides are named in alphabetic order. That means you can bring
them all into a Vim session with the command: vim 0*. vroom --vroom
does exactly that.
