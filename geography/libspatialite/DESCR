SpatiaLite is an open source library intended to extend the SQLite core to
support fully fledged Spatial SQL capabilities. SQLite is intrinsically simple
and lightweight:
* a single lightweight library implementing the full SQL engine
* standard SQL implementation: almost complete SQL-92
* no complex client/server architecture
* a whole database simply corresponds to a single monolithic file (no size
  limits)
* any DB-file can be safely exchanged across different platforms, because the
  internal architecture is universally portable
* no installation, no configuration
SpatiaLite is smoothly integrated into SQLite to provide a complete and
powerful Spatial DBMS (mostly OGC-SFS compliant). Using SQLite + SpatiaLite
you can effectively deploy an alternative open source Spatial DBMS roughly
equivalent to PostgreSQL + PostGIS.
