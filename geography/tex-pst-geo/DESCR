pst-geo is a set of PSTricks related packages for various cartographic
projections of the terrestrial sphere. The package pst-map2d provides
conventional projections such as Mercator, Lambert, cylindrical, etc.
The package pst-map3d treats representation in three dimensions of the
terrestrial sphere. Packages pst-map2dII and pst-map3dII allow use of
the CIA World DataBank II. Various parameters of the packages allow for
choice of the level of the detail and the layouts possible (cities,
borders, rivers etc). Substantial data files are provided, in an
(internally) compressed format. Decompression happens on-the-fly as a
document using the data is displayed, printed or converted to PDF
format. A Perl script is provided for the user to do the decompression,
if the need should arise.
