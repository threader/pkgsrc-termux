GeoLite2 databases are free IP geolocation databases comparable to,
but less accurate than, MaxMind's GeoIP2 databases.  GeoLite2
databases are updated on the first Tuesday of each month.

IP geolocation is inherently imprecise.  Locations are often near the
center of the population.  Any location provided by a GeoIP database
should not be used to identify a particular address or household.

Use the Accuracy Radius as an indication of geolocation accuracy for
the latitude and longitude coordinates we return for an IP address.
The actual location of the IP address is likely within the area
defined by this radius and the latitude and longitude coordinates.
