Geo::Ellipsoid performs geometrical calculations on the surface of an
ellipsoid. An ellipsoid is a three-dimension object formed from the
rotation of an ellipse about one of its axes. The approximate shape of the
earth is an ellipsoid, so Geo::Ellipsoid can accurately calculate distance
and bearing between two widely-separated locations on the earth's surface.
