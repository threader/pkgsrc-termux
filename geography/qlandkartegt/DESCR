QLandkarte GT is the ultimate outdoor aficionado's tool. It supports GPS maps
in GeoTiff format as well as Garmin's img vector map format. Additional it is
the PC side front end to QLandkarte M, a moving map application for mobile
devices.

Additionally it is a front end to the GDAL tools, to make georeferencing
scanned maps feasible for the normal user. Compared to similar tools like
QGis, it's target users are more on the consumer side than on the scientific
one. QLandkarte GT might not let you select every possible feature of the
GDAL tools, but it will simplify their use to the demands of most users.
