OpenCPN is a free software (GPLv2) project to create a concise chart plotter
and navigation software, for use underway or as a planning tool. OpenCPN is
developed by a team of active sailors using real world conditions for
program testing and refinement.

This plugin is designed to allow users to place objects/items on the OpenCPN
interface and have these georeferenced. This allows the objects/items to move
with the chart and have a definined Latitude and Longitude. There are two
basic types of object/item that can be used: points and paths.

Points are very similar to Waypoints and mark locations on the chart.
Paths joint two or more points together and draw a line between them.
Currently these Points exist: Boundary Point, Text Point,
Electronic Brearing Line (EBL) Point, Dead Reckoning (DR) Point.

These Points are used to construct special types of Paths: Boundary,
Electronic Bearing Line (EBL) and Dead Reckoning (DR).
