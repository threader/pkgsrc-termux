OpenCPN is a free software (GPLv2) project to create a concise chart plotter
and navigation software, for use underway or as a planning tool. OpenCPN is
developed by a team of active sailors using real world conditions for
program testing and refinement.

This package contains data files from the Global Self-consistent,
Hierarchical, High-resolution Shoreline Database which are displayed
when no charts are present.
