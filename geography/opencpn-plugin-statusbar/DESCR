OpenCPN is a free software (GPLv2) project to create a concise chart plotter
and navigation software, for use underway or as a planning tool. OpenCPN is
developed by a team of active sailors using real world conditions for
program testing and refinement.

The status bar plugin provides customizable, easier to read output text
and lower cpu usage than the builtin statusbar.
