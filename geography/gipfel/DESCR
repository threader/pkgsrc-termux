gipfel helps to find the names of mountains or points of interest on a picture.
It uses a database containing names and GPS data. With the given viewpoint (the
point from which the picture was taken) and two known mountains on the picture,
gipfel can compute all parameters needed to compute the positions of other
mountains on the picture.

gipfel can also be used to play around with the parameters manually. But be
warned: It is pretty difficult to find the right parameters for a given picture
manually.

You can think of gipfel as a georeferencing software for arbitrary images (not
only satelite images or maps).

gipfel also has an image stitching mode, which allows to generate panorama
images from multiple images that have been referenced with gipfel. The nice
thing about the new image stitching is that it reuses the code that already
existed for referencing images.
