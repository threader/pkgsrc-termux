Ruby timer collections. Schedule several procs to fire after configurable
delays or at periodic intervals.

This gem is especially useful when you are faced with an API that accepts a
single timeout but you want to run multiple timers on top of it. An example of
such a library is [nio4r](https://github.com/celluloid/nio4r), a
cross-platform Ruby library for using system calls like epoll and kqueue.
