The iCalendar package is a parser/generator of iCalendar files for
use with Python. It follows the RFC 2445 (iCalendar) specification

The package can both generate and parse iCalendar files, and can
easily be used as is.

The aim is to make a package that is fully compliant to RFC 2445,
well designed, simple to use and well documented.
