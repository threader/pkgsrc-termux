This Python module returns a tzinfo object with the local timezone
information under Unix and Win-32. It requires pytz, and returns
pytz tzinfo objects.

This module attempts to fix a glaring hole in pytz, that there is
no way to get the local timezone information, unless you know the
zoneinfo name, and under several Linux distros that's hard or
impossible to figure out.

Also, with Windows different timezone system using pytz isn't of
much use unless you separately configure the zoneinfo timezone
name.

With tzlocal you only need to call get_localzone() and you will
get a tzinfo object with the local time zone info. On some Unices
you will still not get to know what the timezone name is, but you
don't need that when you have the tzinfo file. However, if the
timezone name is readily available it will be used.
