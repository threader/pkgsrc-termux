TZInfo::Data contains data from the IANA Time Zone database packaged as Ruby
modules for use with TZInfo.

TZInfo::Data is the public domain [IANA Time Zone
Database](http://www.iana.org/time-zones) packaged as a set of Ruby modules
for use with [TZInfo](http://tzinfo.github.io).

If TZInfo::Data is installed, TZInfo will automatically use it as its source
of time zone data. If TZInfo::Data is not available, TZInfo will attempt to
use the system zoneinfo files instead. Please refer to the [TZInfo
documentation](http://rubydoc.info/gems/tzinfo/frames) for further details.
