Hebcal is a program which prints out the days in the Jewish calendar
for a given gregorian year.  Hebcal is fairly flexible in terms of which
events in the Jewish calendar it displays.  Each of the following can
be individualy turned on or off:

  The Hebrew date
  Jewish Holdiays (including Yom Ha'atzmaut and Yom HaShoah etc.)
  The weekly Sedrah
  The day of the week
  The days of the Omer
