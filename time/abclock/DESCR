Digital clocks are nice for telling exactly what time it is, but, unlike an
analogue clock, they don't give a spatial representation of time. They don't
show where time is coming from or going to.

On the other hand, a bitmap representation of a mechanical clock doesn't tell
time very accurately if the bitmap is very small. And curves and oblique lines
don't look very nice in a small, low-resolution bitmap.

So, this is something different: an analogue clock that isn't tied to the
design of the mechanical clock, but instead uses the natural properties of
bitmaps: straight lines and rectangles.
