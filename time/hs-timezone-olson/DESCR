A parser and renderer for binary Olson timezone files whose format is
specified by the tzfile(5) man page on Unix-like systems. For more
information about this format, see
http://www.iana.org/time-zones/repository/tz-link.html
Functions are provided for converting the parsed data into TimeZoneSeries
objects from the timezone-series package. On many platforms, binary Olson
timezone files suitable for use with this package are available in the
directory usrshare/zoneinfo and its subdirectories on your computer.
