If you have ever had to use a program that made you type in the
date a certain way and thought "Why can't the computer just figure
out what date I wanted?", this module is for you.

DateTime::Format::Flexible attempts to take any string you give it
and parse it into a DateTime object.

The test file tests 2500+ variations of date/time strings. If you
can think of any that I do not cover, please let me know.
