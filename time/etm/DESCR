etm is an acronym for Event and Task Manager. It provides a format
for using simple text files to store event and task information,
a command line interface for viewing tasks and events in a variety
of convenient ways and a curses-based GUI for creating and modifying
events and tasks as well as viewing them. Alarms are supported for
events and repetition for both events and tasks in a powerful and
flexible manner.

Compared to the combination of wxRemind and yeaGTD, etm provides
the following advantages:

  * an agenda view that shows events and tasks together for the
    next few days rather than one day at a time in separate task
    and event windows.
  * a quick and simple way to enter events and tasks on a single
    line.
  * support for remind but also an independent way of entering
    events with contexts, notes and optional alarms.
  * an interactive GUI that uses curses and thus requires nothing
    more than a terminal window.
