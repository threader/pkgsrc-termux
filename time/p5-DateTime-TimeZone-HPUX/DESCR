This distribution implement detection of the local timezone as defined at
the operating system level, either in $ENV{TZ} or in /etc/TIMEZONE.

HP-UX has its own system for defining timezones. See tztab(4). This is
incompatible with the now common set of timezones known as the Olson DB
that is used by DateTime::TimeZone. This module fixes this hole by
providing the map between the two systems.
