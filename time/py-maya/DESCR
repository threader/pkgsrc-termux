Datetimes are very frustrating to work with in Python, especially when
dealing with different locales on different systems. This library exists
to make the simple things much easier, while admitting that time is an
illusion (timezones doubly so).

Datetimes should be interacted with via an API written for humans.

Maya is mostly built around the headaches and use-cases around parsing
datetime data from websites.
