jrnl is a simple journal application for your command line. Journals
are stored as human readable plain text files - you can put them
into a Dropbox folder for instant syncing and you can be assured
that your journal will still be readable in 2050, when all your
fancy iPad journal applications will long be forgotten.

jrnl also plays nice with the fabulous DayOne and can read and
write directly from and to DayOne Journals.

Optionally, your journal can be encrypted using the 256-bit AES.
