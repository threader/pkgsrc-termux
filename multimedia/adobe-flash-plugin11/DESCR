Netscape compatible plugin for Adobe Flash player.  This package
contains a plugin that enables web browsers to render the Flash
format.

The nspluginwrapper option (enabled by default on non Linux platforms)
permits the use of the the Linux x86 flash player in Firefox browsers
on other x86 systems and x86_64 systems.

For NetBSD this package requires emul.linux.kern.osrelease = 2.6.18
or later, which means it will not work on NetBSD 5.x or older
systems.

Note Adobe Flash Player 11 has already been EOLed in November 2016.
11.2.202.644 is the last version of Flash Player version 11, and
Adobe will no longer provide security fixes for this version.
Please consider security risks to use this old package.

If you are running NetBSD 7.1 and later, you should rather use
the newer adobe-flash-player24, which Adobe still provides
security updates.
