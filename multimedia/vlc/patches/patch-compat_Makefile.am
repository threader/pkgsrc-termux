Revert upstream commit 78d45cc159a0cf1c44feef11a2b9800d9398048e by
RÃ©mi Denis-Courmont <remi@remlab.net>.  Mail asking for that to
be applied upstream was turned down:

The goal is and always was to link the compat library statically into the
VLC plugins. If your OS cannot import symbols from a static library into a
dynamic library, then you are screwed and I cannot help you with that. If
it theoretically can, but libtool fails anyway, then I cannot help you with
that either.
