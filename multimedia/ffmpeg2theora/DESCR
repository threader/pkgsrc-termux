With "ffmpeg2theora" you can convert any file that "ffmpeg" can decode into
the Theora format. Right now the settings are hardcoded into the binary.
The idea is to provide "ffmpeg2theora" as a binary along sites like
"v2v.cc" to enable as many people as possible to encode video clips with
the same settings.
