Gecko Media Player is a browser plugin that uses GNOME MPlayer to play media in
a browser.  It should work with all browsers on Unix-ish systems (Linux, BSD,
Solaris) and use the NS4 API (Mozilla, Firefox, Opera, etc.).  Gecko Media
Player is in heavy development, but I wanted to get some code drops out there
so that people can start using and testing it.
