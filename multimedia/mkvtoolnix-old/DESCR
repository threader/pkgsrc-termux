MKVtoolnix is a set of tools to create, alter and inspect Matroska files.

With these tools one can get information about (mkvinfo) Matroska files,
extract tracks/data from (mkvextract) Matroska files and create (mkvmerge)
Matroska files from other media files.

This is a mature version known to compile correctly with g++-4.1.
