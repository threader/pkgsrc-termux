Swfdec is a decoder/renderer for Macromedia Flash animations. The
decoding and rendering engine is provided in a library that can be
used by other applications.

Swfdec is intended to be used as a replacement for the default
Flash player.  While it is not yet a 100% complete replacement, a
big focus is on stability and security. So it is deemed to be
suitable for use in production applications.

The library however is still in heavy development. Because of that,
the Programming interface will change between major versions. No
guarantees are made about the API. However, during stable release
cycles, the API and ABI are guaranteed to stay stable.

An additional library named swfdec-gtk is provided for easy
integration of Swfdec into Gtk applications. This library is what
developers most likely want to target their applications at.
