The Farsight project is an effort to create a framework to deal
with all known audio/video conferencing protocols. On one side it
offers a generic API that makes it possible to write plugins for
different streaming protocols, on the other side it offers an API
for clients to use those plugins.

The main target clients for Farsight are Instant Messaging
applications. These applications should be able to use Farsight
for all their Audio/Video conferencing needs without having to
worry about any of the lower level streaming and NAT traversal
issues.

Farsight forms an integral part of the Telepathy framework. It is
used by Empathy through the Telepathy-Farsight library. It can also
be easily used on embedded platforms by using Stream-Engine. The
Telepathy-Farsight library binds it to the Connection Managers via
D-Bus and the Telepathy Media Stream Spec and is used for all their
streaming requirements.
