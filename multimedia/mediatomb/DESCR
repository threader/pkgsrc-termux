MediaTomb is an open source (GPL) UPnP MediaServer with a nice web
user interface, it allows you to stream your digital media through
your home network and listen to/watch it on a variety of UPnP
compatible devices.

MediaTomb implements the UPnP MediaServer V 1.0 specification that can
be found on http://www.upnp.org/.  The current implementation focuses
on parts that are required by the specification, however we look into
extending the functionality to cover the optional parts of the spec as
well.

MediaTomb should work with any UPnP compliant MediaRenderer, please
tell the authors if you experience difficulties with particular
models, also take a look at the Supported Devices list for more
information.
