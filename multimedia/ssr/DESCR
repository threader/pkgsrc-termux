SimpleScreenRecorder is a Linux program that I've created to record
programs and games. There were already a few programs that could do
this, but I wasn't 100% happy with any of them, so I created my own.
My original goal was to create a program that was just really simple
to use, but as I was writing it I started adding more and more
features, and the result is actually a pretty powerful program. It's
'simple' in the sense that it's easier to use than ffmpeg/avconv or
VLC, because it has a straightforward user interface.
