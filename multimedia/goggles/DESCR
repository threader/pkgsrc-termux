Goggles DVD Player is a frontend for the Ogle DVD player. Besides the
usual features like having a play button etc., Goggles tries to
provide features not often found in other DVD players. Since Ogle
in itself is only a DVD player, it has some neat capabilities that
"general" media players cannot provide. Goggles extends these
capabilities with a very user-friendly interface.

Goggles' attractive and responsive user interface is written using
the FOX Toolkit.
