BD+ is a part of the Blu-ray Disc DRM system. This library provides
an open source implementation of the standard.

This library is not complete, in that it will never be complete
and will always require updates to stay up to date with the latest
Bluray disks released.

The general flow on this library is that the higher level 'player'
code will call us if there exist a "BDSVM/00000.svm" file on the
disk. If this is the case it will call bdplus_init(), connect the
library with other parts of BluRay player and call bdplus_start().

BD+ VM executes the DLX assembled code inside the SVM file.  This
will perform thousands of AES, SHA, file reads and detailed memory
checks to guess the authenticity of the player.

If all goes well, the SVM will eventually spit out a 'conversion
table'. This is a large table (usually about 1-2MB but it varies)
which contains offsets into the M2TS video file. (usually the main
title).
