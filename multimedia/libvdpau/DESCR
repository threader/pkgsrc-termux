The Video Decode and Presentation API for Unix (VDPAU) provides a complete
solution for decoding, post-processing, compositing, and displaying
compressed or uncompressed video streams. These video streams may be
combined (composited) with bitmap content, to implement OSDs and other
application user interfaces.

This VDPAU API allows video programs to offload portions of the video
decoding process and video post-processing to the GPU video-hardware.
