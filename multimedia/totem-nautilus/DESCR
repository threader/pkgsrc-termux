Totem is simple movie player for the GNOME desktop based on GStreamer and
Xine.  It features a playlist, a full-screen mode, seek and volume controls,
as well as a pretty complete keyboard navigation.

This package contains a nautilus extension which adds a "properties"
tab for media file information.
