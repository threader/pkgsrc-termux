MPlayerThumbs is a thumbnail generator for all KDE file managers
(konqueror, dolphin, ...)
It needs mplayer (of course) to generate thumbnails, and it contains
no linking to any library, so in a x86_64 system you can freely use
the 32bit mplayer binary with win32codecs by configuring the
application launching the mplayerthumbsconfig helper application.
