uShare is a UPnP (TM) A/V Media Server. It implements the server component that
provides UPnP media devices with information on available multimedia files.
uShare uses the built-in http server of libupnp to stream the files to clients.

GeeXboX uShare is able to provide access to both images, videos, music or
playlists files (see below for a complete file format support list). It does not
act as an UPnP Media Adaptor and thus, can't transcode streams to fit the client
requirements.

uShare is written in C for the GeeXboX project. It is designed to provide access
to multimedia contents to GeeXboX but can of course be used by any other UPnP
client device. It should compile and run on any modern POSIX compatible system
such as Linux.

uShare is free software - it is licensed under the terms of the GNU General
Public License (GPL).
