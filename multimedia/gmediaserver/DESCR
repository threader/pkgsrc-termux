GMediaServer is a UPnP compatible media server for the GNU system. It is part of
the GNU project.

GMediaServer serves audio and video files to certain network connected media
players. Most hardware media players only play music and/or video--they don't
provide the media themselves. Those media files have to come from a device on
the network. GMediaServer is a server for such UPnP compatible media players,
including:

    * NETGEAR Wireless Digital Music Player (MP101)
    * Linksys(R) Wireless-B Music System (WMLS11B)
    * Linksys(R) Wireless-B Media Link for Music (WML11B)
    * Philips Streamium SL300i
    * Philips Streamium RC9800i
    * Omnifi DMS1
    * SMC EZ Stream 11Mbps Wireless Audio Adaptor (SMCWAA-B)
    * D-Link DSM-520 Wireless HD Media Player
    * Roku SoundBridge Network Music Player M1000
    * Terratec NOXON 2 audio

Other UPnP media players (including software based) may work as well--see the
manual for a more complete list.
