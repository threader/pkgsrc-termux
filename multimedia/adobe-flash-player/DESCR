NPAPI Adobe Flash player plugin for the Firefox browser.
This package contains a plugin that enables web browsers to render
the Flash format.

The nspluginwrapper option (enabled by default on non Linux platforms)
permits the use of the the Linux x86 and x86_64 flash player in Firefox
browsers on other x86 systems and x86_64 systems.

For NetBSD this package requires NetBSD 6.2 or 7.1 (and later versions)
which include procfs fixes for Linux binaries.
