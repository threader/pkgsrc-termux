The Telepathy project is building a unified framework for many
different kinds of real-time communications. It uses the D-Bus
messaging system to provide a simple interface for client applications,
allowing them to quickly take advantage of Telepathy's benefits.

* Real-time: Telepathy supports instant messaging (both one-to-one
and in groups), voice calls and video calls; it's less suited for
store-and-forward applications like email

* Unified: Many different programs can take advantage of these
communications; Telepathy lets these programs work together

* Framework: Telepathy allows the different aspects of communication
handling to be divided between different parts of the system,
meaning each part is simpler
