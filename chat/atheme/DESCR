atheme-services is a set of Services for IRC networks that allows users to
manage their channels in a secure and efficient way and allows operators to
manage various things about their networks. Unlike it's predecessor, Shrike,
services has a completely reworked form of channel management that feels
somewhat like eggdrop and is somewhat more useful.

Services currently works with many irc daemons. More details are
available in the config file.
