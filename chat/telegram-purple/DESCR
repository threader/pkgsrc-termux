Telegram is a cloud-based instant messaging service. Telegram clients exist for
both mobile (Android, iOS, Windows Phone, Ubuntu Touch) and desktop systems
(Windows, OS X, Linux). Users can send messages and exchange photos, videos,
stickers and files of any type up to 1.5 GB in size. Telegram also provides
optional end-to-end encrypted messaging with self-destruct timers.

This package contains a libpurple protocol plugin that adds support for the
Telegram messenger.
