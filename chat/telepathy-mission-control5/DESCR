Mission Control, or MC, is a Telepathy component providing a way
for "end-user" applications to abstract some of the details of
connection managers, to provide a simple way to manipulate a bunch
of connection managers at once, and to remove the need to have in
each program the account definitions and credentials.

Misson Control implements some well-defined API's much like each
connection manager respond to a set of well-defined telepathy API's.
The set of API's implemented by MCs will be split in several
interfaces to ease progressive and adaptative implementation of
each facet.

There are different types of files that the MC will use, and that
are installed by the various connection managers package or
third-party application needing to be hooked-in. MC is able to
handle all those file formats as expected.
