Simple DirectMedia Layer is a cross-platform development library designed to
provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics
hardware via OpenGL and Direct3D. It is used by video playback software,
emulators, and popular games including Valve's award winning catalog and many
Humble Bundle games.

SDL officially supports Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, iOS, and Android. Support for
other platforms may be found in the source code.

SDL is written in C, works natively with C++, and there are bindings available
for several other languages, including C# and Python.

SDL 2.0 is distributed under the zlib license. This license allows you to use
SDL freely in any software.
