Error - Error/exception handling in an OO-ish way (using try/catch/etc.)

The Error package provides two interfaces. Firstly Error provides
a procedural interface to exception handling. Secondly Error is a
base class for errors/exceptions that can either be thrown, for
subsequent catch, or can simply be recorded.

Using the "Error" module is no longer recommended due to the black-magical
nature of its syntactic sugar, which often tends to break. Its maintainers
have stopped actively writing code that uses it, and discourage people
from doing so.
