American Fuzzy Lop is a brute-force fuzzer coupled with an exceedingly
simple but rock-solid instrumentation-guided genetic algorithm. It
uses an enhanced form of edge coverage to easily detect subtle,
local-scale changes to program control flow, without being bogged
down by complex comparisons between multiple long-winded execution
paths.
