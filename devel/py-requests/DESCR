Requests takes all of the work out of Python HTTP/1.1 - making your
integration with web services seamless. There's no need to manually add query
strings to your URLs, or to form-encode your POST data. Keep-alive and HTTP
connection pooling are 100% automatic, powered by urllib3, which is embedded
within Requests.
