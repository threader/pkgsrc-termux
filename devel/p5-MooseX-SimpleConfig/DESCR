This role loads simple configfiles to set object attributes. It is based on the
abstract role MooseX::ConfigFromFile, and uses Config::Any to load your
configfile. Config::Any will in turn support any of a variety of different
config formats, detected by the file extension. See Config::Any for more
details about supported formats.

Like all MooseX::ConfigFromFile -derived configfile loaders, this module is
automatically supported by the MooseX::Getopt role as well, which allows
specifying -configfile on the commandline.
