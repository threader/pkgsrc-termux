Different operating systems provide different ways to wait for I/O completion
events: there's select(), poll(), epoll() and kqueue(). For cross-platform
applications it can be a pain to support all this system functions, especially
because each one provides a different interface.

IOWait solves this problem by providing a unified interface and using always
the best and faster function available in the platform. Its only limitation is
that, on Windows, it only works for sockets.

This library is compatible both with Python 2 and 3.
