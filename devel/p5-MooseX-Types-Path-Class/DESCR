MooseX::Types::Path::Class creates common Moose types, coercions
and option specifications useful for dealing with Path::Class
objects as Moose attributes.

Coercions (see Moose::Util::TypeConstraints) are made from both
'Str' and 'ArrayRef' to both Path::Class::Dir and Path::Class::File
objects. If you have MooseX::Getopt installed, the Getopt option
type ("=s") will be added for both Path::Class::Dir and Path::Class::File.
