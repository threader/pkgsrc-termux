libusb-compat-0.1 is a replacement for libusb-0.1. However, instead
of being an actual implementation, libusb-0.1 is more of a
compatibility layer (or wrapper) which just converts libusb-0.1
calls into their libusb-1.0 equivalents.

It aims to look, feel and behave exactly like libusb-0.1. As it is
a replacement, you cannot install it alongside libusb-0.1 on the
same system.

As the compatibility layer implements the exact same ABI and API,
no modifications to existing libusb-0.1-based applications are
needed. You do not even have to recompile them. This compatibility
layer is a drop-in replacement.
