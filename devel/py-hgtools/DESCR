hgtools builds on the setuptools_hg plugin for setuptools. hgtools provides
classes for inspecting and working with repositories in the Mercurial version
control system.

hgtools provides a plugin for setuptools that enables setuptools to find files
under the Mercurial version control system.

The classes provided by hgtools are designed to work natively with the
Mercurial Python libraries (in process) or fall back to using the command-line
program hg(1) if available. The command-line support is especially useful
inside virtualenvs that don't have access to a system-wide installed Mercurial
lib (i.e. when the virtualenv was created with --no-site-packages).
