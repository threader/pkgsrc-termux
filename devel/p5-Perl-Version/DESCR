The Perl 5 module Perl::Version provides a simple interface for
parsing, manipulating and formatting Perl version strings.
Unlike version.pm (which concentrates on parsing and comparing
version strings) Perl::Version is designed for cases where you'd
like to parse a version, modify it and get back the modified version
formatted like the original.
