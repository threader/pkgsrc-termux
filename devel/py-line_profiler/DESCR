line_profiler will profile the time individual lines of code take to
execute. The profiler is implemented in C via Cython in order to reduce
the overhead of profiling. Also included is the script kernprof, which
can be used to conveniently profile Python applications and scripts
either with line_profiler or with the function-level profiling tools in
the Python standard library.
