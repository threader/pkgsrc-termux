This module provides a framework to produce sprite animations using
ASCII art. Each ASCII 'sprite' is given one or more frames, and
placed into the animation as an 'animation entity'. An animation
entity can have a callback routine that controls the position and
frame of the entity. The module can also do collision detection
between entities.
