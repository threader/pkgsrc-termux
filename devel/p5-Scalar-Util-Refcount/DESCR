Provides two functions to show reference counts of Perl objects.

This can be handy when testing/debugging and you want to know what the heck
is going on.

This is a trivial module. The documentation is longer than the code. Heck,
the BSD license at the top of the file is longer than the code. It took
longer to make it release-ready than it took to write it.

Provides:
  - refcount
  - refcount_sv
