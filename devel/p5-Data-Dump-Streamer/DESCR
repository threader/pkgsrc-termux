The Perl 5 module Data::Dump::Streamer provides functions to accurately
serialize a data structure as Perl code.  Given a list of scalars
or reference variables their contents can be written out in perl
syntax.  The references can also be objects. The contents of each
variable is output using the least number of Perl statements as
convenient, usually only one.  Self-referential structures, closures,
and objects are output correctly
