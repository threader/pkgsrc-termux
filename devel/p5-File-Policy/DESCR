The Perl 5 module File::Policy purpose is to allow systems
administrators to define locations and restrictions for
applications' file I/O and give app developers a policy to follow.
Note that the module doesn't ENFORCE the policy - application
developers can choose to ignore it (and systems administrators can
choose not to install their applications if they do!).
