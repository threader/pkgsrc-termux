This module is intended as a tool for module authors who would like
to easily test that a module release will not break dependencies.
This is particularly useful for module authors (like myself) who
have modules which are a dependency of many other modules.

Internally, this module will download dependencies from CPAN and
run their tests. If those dependencies in turn have unsatisfied
dependencies, they are installed into a temporary directory. These
second-level (and third-, etc) dependencies are not tested.
