CGEN (pronounced seejen) is a framework for developing generators
of CPU-related tools such as assemblers, disassemblers and simulators.
It specifies a description language for describing the architecture
and organization of a CPU without reference to any particular
application. Additional applications can be written within the
framework. CGEN is written in Scheme and can be run under the GNU
Guile interpreter. It is placed under a free software license.
