Seamless printing to the terminal (stdout) and logging to a io.Writer (file)
that's as easy to use as fmt.Println.

JWW is primarily a wrapper around the excellent standard log library. It
provides a few advantages over using the standard log library alone.

1. Ready to go out of the box.
2. One library for both printing to the terminal and logging (to files).
3. Really easy to log to either a temp file or a file you specify.

I really wanted a very straightforward library that could seamlessly do the
following things.

1. Replace all the println, printf, etc statements thought my code with
   something more useful
2. Allow the user to easily control what levels are printed to stdout
3. Allow the user to easily control what levels are logged
4. Provide an easy mechanism (like fmt.Println) to print info to the user
   which can be easily logged as well
5. Due to 2 & 3 provide easy verbose mode for output and logs
6. Not have any unnecessary initialization cruft. Just use it.
