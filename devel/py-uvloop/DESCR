uvloop is a fast, drop-in replacement of the built-in asyncio event loop.

uvloop and asyncio, combined with the power of async/await in Python 3.5,
makes it easier than ever to write high-performance networking code in Python.

uvloop makes asyncio fast. In fact, it is at least 2x faster than nodejs,
gevent, as well as any other Python asynchronous framework. The performance
of uvloop-based asyncio is close to that of Go programs.
