Throwable is a role for classes that are meant to be thrown as exceptions
to standard program flow. It is very simple and does only two things:
saves any previous value for $@ and calls die $self.

Throwable::Error is a base class for exceptions that will be thrown to
signal errors and abort normal program flow. Throwable::Error is an
alternative to Exception::Class, the features of which are largely provided
by the Moose object system atop which Throwable::Error is built.

Throwable::Error performs the Throwable role.
