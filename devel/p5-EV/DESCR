This module provides an interface to libev
(http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/libev.html). While the documentation is
comprehensive, one might also consult the documentation of libev itself
(http://pod.tst.eu/http://cvs.schmorp.de/libev/ev.pod or perldoc EV::libev)
for more subtle details on watcher semantics or some discussion on the
available backends, or how to force a specific backend with LIBEV_FLAGS,
or just about in any case because it has much more detailed information.

This module is very fast and scalable. It is actually so fast that you can
use it through the AnyEvent module, stay portable to other event loops (if
you don't rely on any watcher types not available through it) and still be
faster than with any other event loop currently supported in Perl.
