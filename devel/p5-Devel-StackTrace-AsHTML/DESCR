The Perl 5 module Devel::StackTrace::AsHTML adds as_html method to
Devel::StackTrace which displays the stack trace in beautiful HTML,
with code snippet context and function parameters. If you call it
on an instance of Devel::StackTrace::WithLexicals, you even get to
see the lexical variables of each stack frame.
