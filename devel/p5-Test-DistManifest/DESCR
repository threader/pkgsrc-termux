This module provides a simple method of testing that a MANIFEST matches the
distribution.

It tests three things:

    Everything in MANIFEST exists
    Everything in the package is listed in MANIFEST, or subsequently matches a
    regular expression mask in MANIFEST.SKIP
    Nothing exists in MANIFEST that also matches a mask in MANIFEST.SKIP, so
    as to avoid an unsatisfiable dependency conditions

If there is no MANIFEST.SKIP included in your distribution, this module will
replicate the toolchain behaviour of using the default system-wide
MANIFEST.SKIP file. To view the contents of this file, use the command:

  $ perldoc -m ExtUtils::MANIFEST.SKIP
