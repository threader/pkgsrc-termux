'patch' takes a patch file containing a difference listing
produced by diff and applies those differences to one or
more original files, producing patched versions.

This is the BSD licensed version derived from Larry Wall's original
version.  It differs from the GPL version in less hard-coded limits
and more intelligent reject files.
