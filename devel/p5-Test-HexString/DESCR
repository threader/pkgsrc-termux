The Perl 5 module Test::HexString provides a single function,
is_hexstr(), which asserts that the given string matches what was
expected. When the strings match (i.e. compare equal using the eq
operator), the behaviour is identical to the usual is() function
provided by Test::More. When the strings are different, a hex dump
is produced as diagnostic, rather than the string values being
printed raw
