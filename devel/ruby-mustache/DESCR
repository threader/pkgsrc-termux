Inspired by ctemplate and et, Mustache is a framework-agnostic way
to render logic-free views.
As ctemplates says, "It emphasizes separating logic from presentation:
it is impossible to embed application logic in this template language."
For a list of implementations (other than Ruby) and tips, see
