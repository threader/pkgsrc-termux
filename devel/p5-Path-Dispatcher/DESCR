The Perl 5 module Path::Dispatcher is similar to the module
Jifty::Dispatcher but its use is for the command line.

The basic operation is that of dispatch. Dispatch takes a path and
a list of rules, and it returns a list of matches. From there you
can "run" the rules that matched. These phases are distinct so that,
if you need to, you can inspect which rules were matched without
ever running their codeblocks.
