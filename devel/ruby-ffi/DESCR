== DESCRIPTION:

Ruby-FFI is a ruby extension for programmatically loading dynamic
libraries, binding functions within them, and calling those functions
from Ruby code.  Moreover, a Ruby-FFI extension works without changes
on Ruby and JRuby.

Discover why should you write your next extension using Ruby-FFI
here[http://wiki.github.com/ffi/ffi/why-use-ffi].

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* It has a very intuitive DSL
* It supports all C native types
* It supports C structs (also nested), enums and global variables
* It supports callbacks
* It has smart methods to handle memory management of pointers and structs
