Modules often have optional requirements, for example dependencies that are
useful for (optional) tests, but not required for the module to work
properly.

Usually you want all developers of a project to have these optional modules
installed. However, simply telling everyone or printing diagnostic messages
if optional dependencies are missing often isn't enough to make sure all
authors have all optional modules installed.
