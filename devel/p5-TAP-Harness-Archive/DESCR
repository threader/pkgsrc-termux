This module is a direct subclass of TAP::Harness and behaves in exactly
the same way except for one detail. In addition to outputting a running
progress of the tests and an ending summary it can also capture all of
the raw TAP from the individual test files or streams into an archive
file (".tar" or ".tar.gz").
