There are two kinds of entities in:
				${PREFIX}/include/atomic_ops/sysdeps

- Subdirectories corresponding to specific compilers
  (or compiler/OS combinations).

  Each of these includes one or more architecture-specific headers.

- More generic header files corresponding to a particular ordering and/or
  atomicity property that might be shared by multiple hardware platforms.
