File::Find::Rule::PPI allows you to integrate PPI content queries into your
File::Find::Rule searches.

Initially, it provides the one additional method ppi_find_any, which takes an
argument identical to the PPI::Node method find_any and checks each file as a
perl document to see if matches the query.
