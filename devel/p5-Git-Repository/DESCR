Git::Repository is an interface to Git for the Perl programming language,
for scripted interactions with repositories. It's a low-level interface
that allows calling any Git command, whether porcelain or plumbing,
including bidirectional commands such as git commit-tree.

A Git::Repository object simply provides context to the git commands being
run. It is possible to call the command() and run() methods against the
class itself, and the context (typically current working directory) will
be obtained from the options and environment.
