svn-bisect is a small tool to determine which revision of a subversion
repository contains a change. It does this by employing a binary search.
It will manage the current revision of your checkout directory, and
narrow in on the target revision, as you give it clues about the current
revision such as "before" (this revision is before the one you want) or
"after" (this revision is after the one you want).
