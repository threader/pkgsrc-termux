PCRE2 is a re-working of the original PCRE library to provide an entirely new
API.

PCRE2 is written in C, and it has its own API. There are three sets of
functions, one for the 8-bit library, which processes strings of bytes, one for
the 16-bit library, which processes strings of 16-bit values, and one for the
32-bit library, which processes strings of 32-bit values. There are no C++
wrappers.
