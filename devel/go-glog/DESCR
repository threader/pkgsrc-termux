Package glog implements logging analogous to the Google-internal
C++ INFO/ERROR/V setup.  It provides functions Info, Warning,
Error, Fatal, plus formatting variants such as Infof. It
also provides V-style logging controlled by the -v and
-vmodule=file=2 flags.

This is an efficient pure Go implementation of leveled logs in the
manner of the open source C++ package
	https://github.com/google/glog
	(pkgsrc/devel/google-glog)

By binding methods to booleans it is possible to use the log package
without paying the expense of evaluating the arguments to the log.
Through the -vmodule flag, the package also provides fine-grained
control over logging at the file level.
