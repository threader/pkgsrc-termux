pythondialog is a Python wrapper for the dialog utility originally
written by Savio Lam, and later rewritten by Thomas E. Dickey. Its
purpose is to provide an easy to use, pythonic and comprehensive Python
interface to dialog. This allows one to make simple text-mode user
interfaces on Unix-like systems (including Linux).

This package is the officially maintained version of pythondialog. It
supports Python 3.x only.
