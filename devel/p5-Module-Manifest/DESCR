Module::Manifest is a simple utility module created originally for use in
Module::Inspector.

It can load a MANIFEST file that comes in a Perl distribution tarball,
examine the contents, and perform some simple tasks. It can also load the
MANIFEST.SKIP file and check that.

Granted, the functionality needed to do this is quite simple, but the Perl
distribution MANIFEST specification contains a couple of little
idiosyncracies, such as line comments and space-seperated inline comments.

The use of this module means that any little nigglies are dealt with behind
the scenes, and you can concentrate the main task at hand.
