This package provides an implementation of the ideas presented in the paper
"Functional Pearl: Implicit Configurations" by Oleg Kiselyov and
Chung-chieh Shan. However, the API has been streamlined to improve
performance.

The original paper can be obtained from
http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~ccshan/prepose/prepose.pdf.

For a summary of the approach taken by this library, along with more
motivating examples, see Austin Seipp's tutorial at
