Sick of writing 00_load.t (or something like that) that do use_ok() for every
written module? Even sicker of updating 00_load.t every time adding another file
to the distro? This module reads MANIFEST to find modules to be tested and does
use_ok() for each of them. Now all to do is keeping MANIFEST up to date.
