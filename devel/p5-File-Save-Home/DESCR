This Perl extension provides several functions which try to determine whether
you can, indeed, safely create directories and files underneath a user's home
directory. Among other things, if you are placing a file in such a location
only temporarily -- say, for testing purposes -- you can temporarily hide any
already existing file with the same name and restore it to its original name
and timestamps when you are done.
