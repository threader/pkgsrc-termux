This is another framework for writing test scripts. It is loosely
inspired by Test::More, and has most of it's functionality, but it
is not a drop-in replacement.

Test::More (and other existing test frameworks) suffer from two weaknesses:

   None offer the ability to access specific tests in a reasonably
   interactive fashion

   None offer the ability to write the tests in whatever format
   would make the tests the most readable
