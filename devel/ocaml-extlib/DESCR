ExtLib is a project aiming at providing a complete - yet small - standard
library for the OCaml programming langage. The purpose of this library is to
add new functions to OCaml Standard Library modules, to modify some functions
in order to get better performances or more safety (tail-recursive) but also
to provide new modules which should be useful for the average OCaml programmer.
