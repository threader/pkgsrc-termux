This module gives direct access to some of the internal Perl routines
that let you store things in arrays and hashes. The following
functions are available:

av_store(@array, $index, $value)

    Stores $value in @array at the specified $index. After executing
    this call, $array[$index] and $value denote the same thing.

av_push(@array, $value)

    Pushes $value onto the @array. After executing this call,
    $array[-1] and $value denote the same thing.

hv_store(%hash, $key, $value);

    Stores $value in the %hash with the given $key. After executing
    this call, $hash{$key} and $value denote the same thing.
