hdevtools is a backend for text editor plugins, to allow for things such as
syntax and type checking of Haskell code, and retrieving type information,
all directly from within your text editor.

The advantage that hdevtools has over competitors, is that it runs silently
in a persistent background process, and therefore is able to keeps all of
your Haskell modules and dependent libraries loaded in memory. This way,
when you change only a single source file, only it needs to be reloaded and
rechecked, instead of having to reload everything.

This makes hdevtools very fast for checking syntax and type errors (runs
just as fast as the :reload command in GHCi).
