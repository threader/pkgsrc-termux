Polyglot provides a registry of file types that can be loaded by calling
its improved version of 'require'. Each file extension that can be handled
by a custom loader is registered by callingPolyglot.register("ext", <class>),
and then you can simply require "somefile", which will find and load
"somefile.ext" using your custom loader.
