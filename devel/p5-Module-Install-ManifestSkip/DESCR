This module generates a MANIFEST.SKIP file for you (using
Module::Manifest::Skip) that contains the common files that people do not
want in their MANIFEST files. The SKIP file is generated each time that you
(the module author) run Makefile.PL.

You can add your own custom entries at the top of the MANIFEST file. Just
put a blank line after your entries, and they will be left alone.

This module also adds 'MANIFEST' to the clean_files() list so that make
clean will remove your MANIFEST.
