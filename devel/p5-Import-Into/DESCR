Writing exporters is a pain. Some use Exporter, some use Sub::Exporter,
some use Moose::Exporter, some use Exporter::Declare ... and some things
are pragmas.

If you want to re-export other things, you have to know which is which.
Exporter subclasses provide export_to_level, but if they overrode their
import method all bets are off. Sub::Exporter provides an into parameter
but figuring out something used it isn't trivial. Pragmas need to have
their import method called directly since they affect the current unit
of compilation.

It's ... annoying.

However, there is an approach that actually works for all of these types.
