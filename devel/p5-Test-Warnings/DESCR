This module is intended to be used as a drop-in replacement for
Test::NoWarnings: it also adds an extra test, but runs this test
before done_testing calculates the test count, rather than after.
It does this by hooking into done_testing as well as via an END
block. You can declare a plan, or not, and things will still Just
Work.
