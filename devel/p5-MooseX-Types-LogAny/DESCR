The motivation behind this modules is that Log::Any::Adapter::Null does
not inherit from Log::Any::Adapter::Base which all of the other adapters
do. Moose will not allow a type union of undefined types unless they are
Moose classes. This module allows you to simply use the LogAny type which
has done the union for you.
