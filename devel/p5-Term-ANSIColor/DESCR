This module has two interfaces, one through color() and colored()
and the other through constants. It also offers the utility function
uncolor(), which has to be explicitly imported to be used (see
"SYNOPSIS").

color() takes any number of strings as arguments and considers them
to be space-separated lists of attributes. It then forms and returns
the escape sequence to set those attributes. It doesn't print it
out, just returns it, so you'll have to print it yourself if you
want to (this is so that you can save it as a string, pass it to
something else, send it to a file handle, or do anything else with
it that you might care to).

uncolor() performs the opposite translation, turning escape sequences
into a list of strings.
