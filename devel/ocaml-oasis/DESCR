OASIS is a tool to integrate a configure, build and install system in your
OCaml project. It helps to create standard entry points in your build system
and allows external tools to analyse your project easily.

Note that this package contains the development tools, i.e. what is needed
to add OASIS support to a project. It is not usually needed to build or package
projects that use OASIS.
