This module adds an additional target to the Makefile generated by
ExtUtils::MakeMaker. The target, testcover, calls cover, the command-line
script to generate test coverage statistics, to clean up any data from a
previous run. It then runs the tests, as if make test was run, then calls
cover again to generate the coverage statistics.
