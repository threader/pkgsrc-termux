You must configure RT by editing ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/RT_SiteConfig.pm.

To initialize the RT database, run

	${PREFIX}/sbin/rt-setup-database --action init \
	    --dba dbadmin --prompt-for-dba-password \
	    --datadir ${RTSHAREDIR}/etc

as a user in the ${RT_GROUP} group or as superuser.  In the previous
command-line, 'dbadmin' stands for the database administrator's username,
e.g. 'root' for MySQL.

To upgrade the RT database from an older version, look in
${PREFIX}/share/rt3/etc/upgrade, and for each version newer than the one
previously used, do the following:

	${PREFIX}/sbin/rt-setup-database --action schema \
	    --dba dbadmin --prompt-for-dba-password \
	    --datadir ${RTSHAREDIR}/etc/upgrade/<version>
	${PREFIX}/sbin/rt-setup-database --action acl \
	    --dba dbadmin --prompt-for-dba-password \
	    --datadir ${RTSHAREDIR}/etc/upgrade/<version>
	${PREFIX}/sbin/rt-setup-database --action insert \
	    --dba dbadmin --prompt-for-dba-password \
	    --datadir ${RTSHAREDIR}/etc/upgrade/<version>

You might also want to clear the Mason cache:

	rm -Rf ${RTVARDIR}/mason_data/obj

UPGRADING FROM 3.8.8 and earlier:

Previous versions of RT used a password hashing scheme which was too
easy to reverse, which could allow attackers with read access to the
RT database to possibly compromise users' passwords.  Even if RT does
no password authentication itself, it may still store these weak
password hashes -- using ExternalAuth does not guarantee that you are
not vulnerable!  To upgrade stored passwords to a stronger hash, run:

    perl ${RTSHAREDIR}/etc/vulnerable-passwords

at this point.

For other upgrading actions, see ${RTSHAREDIR}/etc/UPGRADING
