The Perl 5 module Package::Generator lets you quickly and easily
construct new packages.  It gives them unused names and sets up
their package data, if provided.
Also included in this package is the Perl 5 module Package::Reaper.
This module allows you to create simple objects which, when destroyed,
delete a given package.  This lets you approximate lexically scoped
packages
