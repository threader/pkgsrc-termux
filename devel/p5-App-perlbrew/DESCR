perlbrew is a program to automate the building and installation of
perl in the user's HOME. At the moment, it installs everything to
~/perl5/perlbrew, and requires you to tweak your PATH by including
a bashrc/cshrc file it provides. You then can benefit from not
having to run 'sudo' commands to install cpan modules because those
are installed inside your HOME too. It's almost like an isolated
perl environment.
