The AutoLoader module works with the AutoSplit module and the
__END__ token to defer the loading of some subroutines until they
are used rather than loading them all at once.

To use AutoLoader, the author of a module has to place the definitions
of subroutines to be autoloaded after an __END__ token. (See
perldata.) The AutoSplit module can then be run manually to extract
the definitions into individual files auto/funcname.al.
