libview is VMware's Incredibly Exciting Widgets, a useful collection of
GTK+ widgets used within VMware products, free for everybody's use.
This library consists of several widgets we use in Workstation and other
products. We have benefitted so much from open source that we decided to
give back. These widgets are under the MIT license and are largely
written in C++ for GTKMM.
