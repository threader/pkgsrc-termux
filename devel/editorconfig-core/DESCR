Editorconfig C library command line client. This library is used by
editorconfig plugins that are written in C and those that use the
command line interface to editorconfig. Editorconfig reads .editorconfig
files that define a coding style for a project. This allows the coding
style to be set by the project instead of the developer. Then the
developer does not have to change style between each project, the editor
knows the coding style of a file that belongs to a certain project.
