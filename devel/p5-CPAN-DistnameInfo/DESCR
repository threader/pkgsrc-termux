Many online services that are centered around CPAN attempt to
associate multiple uploads by extracting a distribution name from
the filename of the upload. For most distributions this is easy as
they have used ExtUtils::MakeMaker or Module::Build to create the
distribution, which results in a uniform name. But sadly not all
uploads are created in this way.

CPAN::DistnameInfo uses heuristics that have been learnt by
http://search.cpan.org/ to extract the distribution name and version
from filenames and also report if the version is to be treated as
a developer release
