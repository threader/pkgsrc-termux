This module adds the ability to quickly create new types of TIE objects
without creating a complete class. It does so in such a way as to try and
make the programmers life easier when it comes to single-use ties that I
find myself wanting to use from time-to-time.

The Tie::Simple package is actually a front-end to other classes which
really do all the work once tied, but this package does the dwimming to
automatically figure out what you're trying to do.
