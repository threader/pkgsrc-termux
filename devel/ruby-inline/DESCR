Ruby Inline is an analog to Perl's Inline::C.  Out of the box, it allows
you to embed C/++ external module code in your ruby script directly.
By writing simple builder classes, you can teach how to cope with new
languages (fortran, perl, whatever).  The code is compiled and run on
the fly when needed.
