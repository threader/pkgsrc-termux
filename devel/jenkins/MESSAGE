To use jenkins with apache tomcat, you will need to perform the following
steps. Of cource you can run jenkins with builtin winstone web server.

1. Install apache tomcat server, for example apache-tomcat7

	# cd www/apache-tomcat7
	# make install

2. Set jenkins location to apache tomcat
	$ sudo vi ${PREFIX}/share/tomcat/conf/server.xml
	Add
	<Context path="/jenkins" docBase="${PREFIX}/share/jenkins"
		debug="0" reloadable="true">
	</Context>
	in <Host> tag

3. Set URI Encoding as UTF-8
	$ vi ${PREFIX}/share/tomcat/conf/server.xml
	You should have
	URIEncoding="UTF-8"
	in <Connector/> tag. For example, you should have the following
	lines.
	<Connector port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
		connectionTimeout="20000"
		redirectPort="8443" URIEncoding="UTF-8"/>

4. Start apache tomcat and access http://localhost:8080/jenkins/
