ConfigObj is a simple but powerful config file reader and writer:
an ini file round tripper. Its main feature is that it is very easy to use,
with a straightforward programmer's interface and a simple syntax for
config files. It has lots of other features though :

    * Nested sections (subsections), to any level
    * List values
    * Multiple line values
    * String interpolation (substitution)
    * Integrated with a powerful validation system
          o including automatic type checking / conversion
          o repeated sections
          o and allowing default values
    * When writing out config files, ConfigObj preserves all comments
    and the order of members and sections
    * Many useful methods and options for working with configuration files
    (like the 'reload'
    and 'merge' methods)
    * Full Unicode support

This project is also the home of validate which handles the type
checking and conversion for ConfigObj. Support for validate is integrated
into ConfigObj, but it can also be used on its own for reading and implementing
validation specifications
