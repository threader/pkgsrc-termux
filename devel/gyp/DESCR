GYP is a tool for the Chromium project that generates native Visual
Studio, Xcode and SCons and/or make build files from a platform-independent
input format.  The input format is as reasonably general as possible
without spending extra time trying to "get everything right," except
where not doing so would likely lead Chromium to an eventual dead
end. When in doubt, do what Chromium needs and don't worry about
generalizing the solution.
