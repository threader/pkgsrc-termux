This module implements a single feature only of interest to advanced perl
modules, namely asynchronous interruptions (think "UNIX signals", which are
very similar).

Sometimes, modules wish to run code asynchronously (in another thread, or
from a signal handler), and then signal the perl interpreter on certain
events. One common way is to write some data to a pipe and use an event
handling toolkit to watch for I/O events. Another way is to send a signal.
Those methods are slow, and in the case of a pipe, also not asynchronous -
it won't interrupt a running perl interpreter.

This module implements asynchronous notifications that enable you to signal
running perl code from another thread, asynchronously, and sometimes even
without using a single syscall.
