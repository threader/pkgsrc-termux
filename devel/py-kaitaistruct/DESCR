Kaitai Struct is a declarative language used for describe various
binary data structures, laid out in files or in memory: i.e. binary
file formats, network stream packet formats, etc.

The main idea is that a particular format is described in Kaitai
Struct language (.ksy file) and then can be compiled with ksc into
source files in one of the supported programming languages. These
modules will include a generated code for a parser that can read
described data structure from a file / stream and give access to
it in a nice, easy-to-comprehend API.
