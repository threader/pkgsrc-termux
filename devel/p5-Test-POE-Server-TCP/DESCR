Test::POE::Server::TCP is a POE component that provides a TCP server
framework for inclusion in client component test cases, instead of
having to roll your own.

Once registered with the component, a session will receive events
related to client connects, disconnects, input and flushed output. Each
of these events will refer to a unique client ID which may be used in
communication with the component when sending data to the client or
disconnecting a client connection.
