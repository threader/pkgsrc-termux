Given a list of Perl modules/filenames, this module makes require and use
statements fail (no matter the specified files/modules are installed or
not).

They die with a message like:

    Can't locate Module/ToHide.pm (hidden)

The intent of this module is to allow Perl developers to test for
alternative behavior when some modules are not available. In a Perl
installation, where many modules are already installed, there is a
chance to screw things up because you take for granted things that
may not be there in other machines.
