txaio is a helper library for writing code that runs unmodified on
both Twisted and asyncio / Trollius.

This is like six, but for wrapping over differences between Twisted
and asyncio so one can write code that runs unmodified on both (aka
source code compatibility). In other words: your users can choose
if they want asyncio or Twisted as a dependency.

Note that, with this approach, user code runs under the native event
loop of either Twisted or asyncio. This is different from attaching
either one's event loop to the other using some event loop adapter.
