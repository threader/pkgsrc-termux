flexmock is a testing library for Python that makes it easy to create mocks,
stubs and fakes.

The API is inspired by a Ruby library of the same name, but Python flexmock is
not a clone of the Ruby version. It omits a number of redundancies in the Ruby
flexmock API, alters some defaults, and introduces a number of Python-only
features.

flexmock's design focuses on simplicity and intuitiveness. This means that the
API is as lean as possible, though a few convenient short-hand methods are
provided to aid brevity and readability.

flexmock declarations are structured to read more like English sentences than
API calls, and it is possible to chain them together in any order to achieve
high degree of expressiveness in a single line of code.

In addition, flexmock integrates seamlessly with all major test runners to
reduce even more mock-related boilerplate code.
