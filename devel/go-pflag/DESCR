pflag is a drop-in replacement for Go's flag package, implementing
POSIX/GNU-style --flags.

pflag is compatible with the GNU extensions to the POSIX recommendations for
command-line options. For a more precise description, see the "Command-line
flag syntax" section below.

pflag is available under the same style of BSD license as the Go language,
which can be found in the LICENSE file.
