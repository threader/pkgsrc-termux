Data::Alias provides a comprehensive set of aliasing operations.

Data::Alias is a module that allows you to apply "aliasing semantics"
to a section of code, causing aliases to be made whereever Perl
would normally make copies instead. You can use this to improve
efficiency and readability, when compared to using references.
