This is a declarative specification-style testing system for
behavior-driven development (BDD) in Perl. The tests (a.k.a.
examples) are named with strings instead of subroutine names, so
your fingers will suffer less fatigue from underscore-itis, with
the side benefit that the test reports are more legible.
