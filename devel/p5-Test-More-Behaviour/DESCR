Test::More::Behaviour is a Behaviour-Driven Development module for
Perl programmers. It is modeled after Rspec (http://rspec.info),
the BDD tool for Ruby programmers. Test::More::Behaviour uses the
words `describe` and `it` so we can express concepts of the application
as we would in conversation.

Because Test::More::Behaviour uses Test::More as its 'base', you
can treat every Test::More::Behaviour test as if it were Test::More!
