Snappy is a compression/decompression library.  It does not aim for
maximum compression, or compatibility with any other compression
library; instead, it aims for very high speeds and reasonable
compression.  For instance, compared to the fastest mode of zlib,
Snappy is an order of magnitude faster for most inputs, but the
resulting compressed files are anywhere from 20% to 100% bigger.  On a
single core of a Core i7 processor in 64-bit mode, Snappy compresses
at about 250 MB/sec or more and decompresses at about 500 MB/sec or
more.

Snappy is widely used inside Google, in everything from BigTable and
MapReduce to the internal RPC systems.  (Snappy has previously been
referred to as "Zippy" in some presentations and the likes.)
