p5-strictures provides "strictures" directive.

  use strictures 1;

is equivalent to

  use strict;
  use warnings FATAL => 'all';

except when called from a file where $0 matches:

  /^x?t\/.*(?:load|compile|coverage|use_ok).*\.t$/

and when either '.git' or '.svn' is present in the current directory
