Role::Tiny is a minimalist role composition tool.

ROLE COMPOSITION

Role composition can be thought of as much more clever and meaningful
multiple inheritance. The basics of this implementation of roles is:

    * If a method is already defined on a class, that method will not be
      composed in from the role.
    * If a method that the role "requires" to be implemented is not
      implemented, role application will fail loudly.

Unlike Class::C3, where the last class inherited from "wins," role
composition is the other way around, where the class wins. If multiple
roles are applied in a single call (single with statement), then if any
of their provided methods clash, an exception is raised unless the class
provides a method since this conflict indicates a potential problem.
