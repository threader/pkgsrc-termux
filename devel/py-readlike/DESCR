A Python module that provides GNU Readline-like line editing
functions (the default Emacs-style ones). If you just want to use
Readline, use the readline package in the standard library but this
package allows access to those capabilties in settings outside of
a standard CLI.

Currently, all stateless Readline commands are implemented. This
means that yanking and history aren't supported.

This module is especially well-suited to interfacing with Urwid
due to a shared syntax for describing key inputs.
