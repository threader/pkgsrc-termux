TCLAP is a small, flexible library that provides a simple interface for defining
and accessing command line arguments. It was intially inspired by the user
friendly CLAP libary. The difference is that this library is templatized, so the
argument class is type independent. Type independence avoids
identical-except-for-type objects, such as IntArg, FloatArg, and StringArg.
While the library is not strictly compliant with the GNU or POSIX standards, it
is close.

TCLAP is written in ANSI C++ and is meant to be compatible with any
standards-compliant C++ compiler. It is known to work on Linux, MacOS X,
Windows, and Solaris platforms. The library is implemented entirely in header
files making it easy to use and distribute with other software. It is licensed
under the MIT License for worry free distribution.

TCLAP is now a mature, stable, and feature rich package. Unless I get really
bored, it probably won't see much further development aside from bug fixes and
compatibility updates. Please don't let any apparent project inactivity
discourage you from using the software!
