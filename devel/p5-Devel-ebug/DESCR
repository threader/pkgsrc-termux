The Perl 5 module Devel::ebug is a simple, extensible Perl debugger
with a clean API. With this module, a Perl Perldebugger may easily
be written. There are currently two user interfaces to Devel::debug,
ebug and ebug_http. ebug is a console-based interface to debugging
programs, much like perl5db.pl. ebug_http is an innovative web-based
interface to debugging programs. Devel::ebug is a work in progress.
