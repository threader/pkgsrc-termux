Data::Printer is a Perl module to pretty-print Perl data structures
and objects in full color. It is meant to display variables on
screen, properly formatted to be inspected by a human.

Data::Printer is highly customizable, from indentation size to
depth level. You can even rename the exported p() function!

Data::Printer also lets you create filters to help debugging
your objects easily.
