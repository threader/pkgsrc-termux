"Module::Build" is a system for building, testing, and installing Perl
modules. It is meant to be an alternative to "ExtUtils::MakeMaker".
Developers may alter the behavior of the module through subclassing in a
much more straightforward way than with "MakeMaker". It also does not
require a "make" on your system - most of the "Module::Build" code is
pure-perl and written in a very cross-platform way. See "MOTIVATIONS" for
more comparisons between "ExtUtils::MakeMaker" and "Module::Build". To
install "Module::Build", and any other module that uses "Module::Build" for
its installation process, do the following: perl Build.PL # 'Build.PL'
script creates the 'Build' script ./Build # Need ./ to ensure we're using
this "Build" script ./Build test # and not another one that happens to be
in the PATH ./Build install This illustrates initial configuration and the
running of three 'actions'. In this case the actions run are 'build' (the
default action), 'test', and 'install'. Other actions defined so far
include: build manifest clean manifest_skip code manpages config_data
pardist diff ppd dist ppmdist distcheck prereq_data distclean prereq_report
distdir pure_install distinstall realclean distmeta retest distsign
skipcheck disttest test docs testall fakeinstall testcover help testdb html
testpod install testpodcoverage installdeps versioninstall You can run the
'help' action for a complete list of actions.
