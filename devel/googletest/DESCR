The googletest package provides Google's C++ test writing framework.
It is based on the xUnit architecture and works for a variety of
platforms (Linux, Mac OS X, Windows, Cygwin, Windows CE, and
Symbian). It provides various options for running the tests, a rich
set of assertions, automatic test discovery, and XML test report
generation. It supports type- and value-parameterized tests, death
