This module is an alternative to Data::Dumper::Simple. Many people like the
aforementioned module but do not like the fact that it uses a source filter.
In order to pull off the trick with this module, we use PadWalker. This
introduces its own set of problems, not the least of which is that PadWalker
uses undocumented features of the Perl internals and has an annoying tendency
to break. Thus, if this module doesn't work on your machine you may have to
go back to Data::Dumper::Simple.
