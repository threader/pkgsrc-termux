libhid is a rewrite of libHID[0] and aims to provide the same functionality
from a more organised framework. It aims to provide a layer of abstraction for
accessing HID-class devices over USB or serial lines (similar to what libusb
provides for the base USB protocol).

libhid has been designed because it is needed in two other projects
(libphdigets and nut). As such, it does not have a complete featureset yet but
is rather a work in progress (alpha state). We invite everyone to contribute
or get in touch with us for additional features.
