The Perl 5 module Devel::Dumpvar is a pure object-orientated
reimplementation of the perl-debugger's dumpvar.pl functionality.
This makes it a much more versatile version than other dumping
modules focused on serializing data, to use for dumping information
to debug log files or other uses where you don't need to reassemble
the data.
