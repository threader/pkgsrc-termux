Sometimes we need data split into records and a simple split on
the input record separator ($/) or some other value fails because
the values we're splitting on may allowed in other parts of the
data. Perhaps they're quoted. Perhaps they're embedded in other
data which should not be split up.

This module allows you to specify what you wish to split the data
on, but also speficy an "unless" regular expression. If the text
in question matches the "unless" regex, it will not be split there.
This allows us to do things like split on newlines unless newlines
are embedded in quotes.
