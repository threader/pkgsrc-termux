This is a lightweight module which provides 'Junction' operators, the most
commonly used being any and all.  Inspired by the Perl6 design docs [1].

Provides a limited subset of the functionality of Quantum::Superpositions
([2]).

That if you want to match against a regular expression, you must use == or
!=. Not =~ or !~. You must also use a regex object, such as qr/\d/, not a
plain regex such as /\d/.

This module is actually a fork of Perl6::Junction with very few (initial)
changes. The reason being that we want to avoid the incendiary name
containing Perl6.

Quantum::Superpositions provides the same functionality as this, and more.
However, this module provides this limited functionality at a much greater
runtime speed, with my benchmarks showing between 500% and 6000% improvment.
