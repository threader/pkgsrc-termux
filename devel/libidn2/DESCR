Libidn2 is a free software implementation of IDNA2008, Punycode and TR46
in the form of a library. It contains functionality to convert
internationalized domain names to and from ASCII Compatible Encoding
(ACE), following the IDNA2008 and TR46 standards.

The library is a rewrite of the popular but legacy libidn library, and
is backwards (API) compatible with it.
