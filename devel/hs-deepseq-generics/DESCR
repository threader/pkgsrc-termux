This package provides a GHC.Generics-based
Control.DeepSeq.Generics.genericRnf function which can be used for
providing a rnf implementation. See the documentation for the genericRnf
function in the Control.DeepSeq.Generics module to get started.

The original idea was pioneered in the generic-deepseq package (see
http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell-cafe/2012-February/099551.html for
more information).

This package differs from the generic-deepseq package by working in
combination with the existing deepseq package as opposed to defining a
conflicting drop-in replacement for deepseq's Control.Deepseq module.
