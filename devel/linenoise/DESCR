A minimal, zero-config, BSD licensed, readline replacement.

Noteworthy features:
 - Single and multi line editing mode with the usual key bindings implemented.
 - History handling.
 - Completion.
 - Hints (suggestions at the right of the prompt as you type).
 - About 1,100 lines of BSD license source code.
 - Only uses a subset of VT100 escapes (ANSI.SYS compatible).
