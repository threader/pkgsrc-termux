Cucumber lets software development teams describe how software
should behave in plain text. The text is written in a business-readable
domain-specific language and serves as documentation, automated
tests and development-aid - all rolled into one format.

This is a sane, feature-complete Cucumber implementation in Perl.
In almost all cases, where the behaviour of this module is different
from the real Cucumber, the plan is to move it to be more similar
to that.
