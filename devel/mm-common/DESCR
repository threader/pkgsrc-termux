The mm-common module provides the build infrastructure and utilities shared
among the GNOME C++ binding libraries. It is only a required dependency for
building the C++ bindings from the gnome.org version control repository. An
installation of mm-common is not required for building tarball releases, unless
configured to use maintainer-mode.
