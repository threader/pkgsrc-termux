Citrix XenServer includes a XML-RPC based API, providing programmatic access
to the extensive set of XenServer management features and tools. The
XenServer API can be called from a remote system as well as local to the
XenServer host. Remote calls are generally made securely over HTTPS, using
port 443.

There are five SDKs available, one for each of C, C#, Java, PowerShell, and
Python. These are provided under an open-source license (LGPL or GPL with
the common linking exception). This allows use (unmodified) in both
closed-and open-source applications.

There are also several example code samples also provided for download. Some
of the code samples demonstrate creating a VM, running VM power operations,
and watching for events.

The XenServer 5.6 Feature Pack 1 SDKs are suitable not just for 5.6 FP1
servers, but for use with all versions of XenServer from 4.0 to 5.6 FP1,
making it possible to address multiple XenServer versions with a single
binary. There are, of course, features missing on the older versions, and
client programs are expected to check host.software_version["product_version"]
to gracefully fall back when appropriate.
