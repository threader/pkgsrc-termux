The scanner will extract loosely your distribution prerequisites from your
files.

The extraction may not be perfect but tries to do its best. It will
currently find the following prereqs:
    * plain lines beginning with use or require in your perl modules and
      scripts, including minimum perl version
    * regular inheritance declared with the base and parent pragmata
    * Moose inheritance declared with the extends keyword
    * Moose roles included with the with keyword
    * OO namespace aliasing using the aliased module
