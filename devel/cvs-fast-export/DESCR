This program analyzes a collection of RCS files in a CVS
repository (or outside of one) and, when possible, emits an
equivalent history in the form of a fast-import stream. Not all
possible histories can be rendered this way; the program tries to
emit useful warnings when it can't. The program can also produce
a visualization of the resulting commit DAG in the DOT format
handled by the graphviz suite.
