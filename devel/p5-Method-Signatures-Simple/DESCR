This module provides a basic method keyword with simple signatures.
It's intentionally simple, and is supposed to be a stepping stone
for its bigger brothers MooseX::Method::Signatures and Method::Signatures.
It only has a small benefit over regular subs, so if you want more
features, look at those modules. But if you're looking for a small
amount of syntactic sugar, this might just be enough.
