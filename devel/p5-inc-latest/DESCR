The inc::latest module helps bootstrap configure-time dependencies
for CPAN distributions. These dependencies get bundled into the
inc directory within a distribution and are used by Makefile.PL or
Build.PL.

Arguments to inc::latest are module names that are checked against
both the current @INC array and against specially-named directories
in inc. If the bundled version is newer than the installed one (or
the module isn't installed, then, the bundled directory is added
to the start of @INC and the module is loaded from there.
