stompclient provides a simple and lighweight STOMP client API for Python.

stompclient supports both simplex (publisher-only) and duplex
(publish-subscribe) communication with STOMP servers. This project started as a
fork of the stompy project by Benjamin W. Smith) but has evolved into a very
distinct codebase, which combines a few ideas from stompy with features from
the Stomper library and CoilMQ broker.
