Most applications use constants. Many constants take different
values based on the environment the application is executed in.

Think database credentials over development, testing, staging,
production or stock market execution over development, testing,
paper, production ...

Shamelessly inspired by the app_constants_ gem, ``constants`` aims
to solve that problem (and that problem only).
