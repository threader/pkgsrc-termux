Git::Wrapper provides an API for git(7) that uses Perl data structures
for argument passing, instead of CLI-style --options as Git does.

Except as documented, every git subcommand is available as a method
on a Git::Wrapper object. Replace any hyphens in the git command
with underscores. The first argument should be a hashref containing
options and their values. Boolean options are either true (included)
or false (excluded). The remaining arguments are passed as ordinary
command arguments.
