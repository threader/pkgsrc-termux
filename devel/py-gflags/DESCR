GFlags defines a *distributed* command line system, replacing
systems like getopt(), optparse and manual argument processing.
Rather than an application having to define all flags in or near
main(), each python module defines flags that are useful to it.
When one python module imports another, it gains access to the
other's flags.

It includes the ability to define flag types (boolean, float,
interger, list), autogeneration of help (in both human and machine
readable format) and reading arguments from a file. It also includes
the ability to automatically generate man pages from the help flags.
