This module tries to make install path resolution as easy as possible.

When one wants to install a module, it needs to figure out where to install
things. The nutshell version of how this works is that default installation
locations are determined from ExtUtils::Config, and they may be individually
overridden by using the install_path attribute. An install_base attribute
lets one specify an alternative installation root like /home/foo and prefix
does something similar in a rather different (and more complicated) way.
destdir lets one specify a temporary installation directory like /tmp/install
in case one want to create bundled-up installable packages.
