The pgfkeys package (part of the pgf distribution) is a well-designed
way of defining and using large numbers of keys for key-value
syntaxes. However, pgfkeys itself does not offer means of handling
LaTeX class and package options. This package adds such option
handling to pgfkeys, in the same way that kvoptions adds the same
facility to the LaTeX standard keyval package.
