MooseX::Has::Options provides a succinct syntax for declaring options for
Moose attributes. It hijacks the has function imported by Moose and replaces
it with one that understands following options syntax:

    use Moose;
    use MooseX::Has::Options;

    has 'some_attribute' => (
        qw(:ro :required),
        isa => 'Str',
        ...
    );

This will converted into:

    use Moose;
    use MooseX::Has::Options;

    has 'some_attribute' => (
        is => 'ro',
	required => 1,
        isa => 'Str',
        ...
    );
