The tclreadline package makes the GNU Readline library available for
interactive tcl shells. This includes history expansion and file/command
completion. Command completion for all tcl/tk commands is provided and
commmand completers for user defined commands can be easily added.
tclreadline can also be used for tcl scripts which want to use a shell
like input interface. In this case the ::tclreadline::readline
read command has to be called explicitly.
