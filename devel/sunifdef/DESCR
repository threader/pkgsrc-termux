Sunifdef is a commandline tool for eliminating superfluous preprocessor
clutter from C and C++ source files. It is a more powerful successor to
the FreeBSD 'unifdef' tool.

Sunifdef is most useful to developers of constantly evolving products with
large code bases, where preprocessor conditionals are used to configure
the feature sets, APIs or implementations of different releases. In these
environments the code base steadily accumulates #ifdef pollution as
transient configuration options become obselete. Sunifdef can largely
automate the recurrent task of purging redundant #if logic from the code.
