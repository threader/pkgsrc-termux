This module is a replacement for the most typical use of the h2xs utility
bundled with all Perl distributions: the creation of the directories and
files required for a pure-Perl module to be installable with make and
distributable on the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN).

For Perl programmers, laziness is a virtue -- and modulemaker is far and
away the laziest way to create a pure Perl distribution which meets all
the requirements for worldwide distribution via CPAN.
