The Perl 5 module Test::Expect is a module for automated driving
and testing of terminal-based programs. It is handy for testing
interactive programs which have a prompt, and is based on the same
concepts as the Tcl Expect tool. As in Expect::Simple, the Expect
object is made available for tweaking.
