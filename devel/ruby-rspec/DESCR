Behaviour Driven Development for Ruby

# RSpec Core

rspec-2.x is a meta-gem, which depends on the rspec-core, rspec-expectations
and rspec-mocks gems. Each of these can be installed separately and actived in
isolation with the `gem` command. Among other benefits, this allows you to use
rspec-expectations, for example, in Test::Unit::TestCase if you happen to
prefer that style.

Conversely, if you like RSpec's approach to declaring example groups and
examples (`describe` and `it`) but prefer Test::Unit assertions and mocha, rr
or flexmock for mocking, you'll be able to do that without having to load the
components of rspec that you're not using.
