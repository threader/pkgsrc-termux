Flaky is a plugin for nose or py.test that automatically reruns flaky tests.

Ideally, tests reliably pass or fail, but sometimes test fixtures must rely on
components that arenâ€™t 100% reliable. With flaky, instead of removing those
tests or marking them to @skip, they can be automatically retried.
