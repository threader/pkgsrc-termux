$NetBSD: patch-vm_include_elfsh_h,v 1.1 2011/10/02 23:50:56 dholland Exp $

- wrap decl of dprintf in the same conditional that covers the uses
(there is no definition that I can find, so probably the package won't
build if someone turns that conditional on; not our problem though.

Note that some defs in elfsh.h are substituted by the package Makefile
in the post-patch phase. Don't accidentally roll that change into this
patch.
