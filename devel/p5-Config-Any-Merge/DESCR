Config::Any returns your configuration as a hash of hashes keyed by the
name of the configuration file. This module merges these hashes into a
single hash. If the "override" paramter is set to 0 in the paramters for
"load_files" or "load_stems", configurations files later in the list
can't override variables that are already set. The default is to
override previously set variables. In all other regards Config::Any::Merge
is a strict subclass of Config::Any and inherits all of its functions.
