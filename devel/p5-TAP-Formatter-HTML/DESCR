This module provides HTML output formatting for TAP::Harness (a
replacement for Test::Harness. It is largely based on ideas from
TAP::Test::HTMLMatrix (which was built on Test::Harness and thus
had a few limitations - hence this module). For sample output,
see:

This module is targeted at all users of automated test suites.
It's meant to make reading test results easier, giving you a
visual summary of your test suite and letting you drill down
into individual failures (which will hopefully make testing
more likely to happen at your organization ;-)
