QBzr is a cross-platform GUI front end for Bazaar, based on Qt toolkit.
It provides a graphical user interface for those Bazaar commands where it can
simplify the usage: Highlighting of differences between files, "browsable" log
view, possibility to commit only some files without listing them all on the
command line, etc.
