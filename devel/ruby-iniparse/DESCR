IniParse is a pure Ruby library for parsing

INI[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file] configuration and data files.

=== Main features

* Support for duplicate options.  While not common, some INI files contain an
  option more than once.  IniParse does not overwrite previous options, but
  allows you to access all of the duplicate values.

* Preservation of white space and blank lines.  When writing back to your INI
  file, line indents, white space and comments (and their indents) are
  preserved.  Only trailing white space (which has no significance in INI
  files) will be removed.

* Preservation of section and option ordering.  Sections and options are kept
  in the same order they are in the original document ensuring that nothing
  gets mangled when writing back to the file.
