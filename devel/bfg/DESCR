BFG Repo-Cleaner Removes large or troublesome blobs like
git-filter-branch does, but faster. And written in Scala

The BFG is a simpler, faster alternative to git-filter-branch for
cleansing bad data out of your Git repository history:

- Removing Crazy Big Files
- Removing Passwords, Credentials & other Private data

The git-filter-branch command is enormously powerful and can do things that
the BFG can't - but the BFG is much better for the tasks above, because:

- Faster    : 10 - 720x faster
- Simpler   : The BFG isn't particularily clever, but is focused on making the
              above tasks easy
- Beautiful : If you need to, you can use the beautiful Scala language to
              customise the BFG. Which has got to be better than Bash
              scripting at least some of the time.
