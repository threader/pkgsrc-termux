Shell::Guess makes a reasonably aggressive attempt to determine the
shell being employed by the user, either the shell that executed
the perl script directly (the "running" shell), or the users' login
shell (the "login" shell). It does this by a variety of means
available to it, depending on the platform that it is running on.
