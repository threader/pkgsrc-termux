Thrift is a software library and set of code-generation tools developed
at Facebook to expedite development and implementation of efficient and
scalable backend services. Its primary goal is to enable efficient and
reliable communication across programming languages by abstracting the
portions of each language that tend to require the most customization
into a common library that is implemented in each language.

Specifically, Thrift allows developers to define datatypes and service
interfaces in a single language-neutral file and generate all the
necessary code to build RPC clients and servers.
