Test::Toolbox provides (as you might guess) tools for automated
testing. Test::Toolbox is much like some other testing modules, such as
Test::More and Test::Simple. Test::Toolbox provides a different flavor of
tests which may or may not actually be to your preference.

The tools in Test::Toolbox have a standard format. Commands start with (the
command (of course), followed by the test name. Then there is usually the
value being tested, or values being compared, then other options. So, for
example, this command checks compares two values:

   rtcomp 'test name', $val, $other_val;

In some cases it's preferable to flip the logic of the test, so that, for
example, two values should not be the same. In that case, you can add the
should option:

   rtcomp 'test name', $val, $other_val, should=>0;

All test commands require a test name as the first param.
