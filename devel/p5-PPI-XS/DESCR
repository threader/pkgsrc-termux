PPI::XS provides XS-based acceleration of the core PPI packages. It
selectively replaces a (small but growing) number of methods throughout PPI
with identical but much faster C versions.
Once installed, it will be auto-detected and loaded in by PPI completely
transparently.
Because the C implementations are linked to the perl versions of the same
function, it is preferable to upgrade PPI::XS any time you do a major upgrade
of PPI itself.
