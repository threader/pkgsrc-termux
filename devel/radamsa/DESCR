Radamsa is a test case generator for robustness testing, a.k.a. a fuzzer. It is
typically used to test how well a program can withstand malformed and
potentially malicious inputs. It works by reading sample files of valid data
and generating interestringly different outputs from them. The main selling
points of radamsa are that it has already found a slew of bugs in programs that
actually matter, it is easily scriptable and easy to get up and running.
