TLSH is a fuzzy matching library. Given a byte stream with a minimum
length of 256 bytes (and a minimum amount of randomness - see note
in Python extension below), TLSH generates a hash value which can
be used for similarity comparisons.  Similar objects will have
similar hash values which allows for the detection of similar
objects by comparing their hash values.  Note that the byte stream
should have a sufficient amount of complexity.  For example, a byte
stream of identical bytes will not generate a hash value.
