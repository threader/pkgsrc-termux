The Perl 5 module UUID::Tiny is a lightweight, low dependency Pure
Perl module for UUID creation and testing. This module provides the
creation of version 1 time based UUIDs (using random multicast MAC
addresses), version 3 MD5 based UUIDs, version 4 random UUIDs, and
version 5 SHA-1 based UUIDs.
ATTENTION! UUID::Tiny uses Perl's rand() to create the basic random
numbers, so the created v4 UUIDs are not cryptographically strong!
