This collection of modules allows programs to be written that perform
asynchronous filehandle IO operations. A typical program using them would
consist of a single subclass of IO::Async::Loop to act as a container of
other objects, which perform the actual IO work required by the program. As
well as IO handles, the loop also supports timers and signal handlers, and
includes more higher-level functionality built on top of these basic parts.
