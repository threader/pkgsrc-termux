The 'Log::Handler' is a object oriented handler for logging, tracing and
debugging. It is very easy to use and provides a simple interface for
multiple output objects with lots of configuration parameters. You can
easily filter the amount of logged information on a per-output base,
define priorities, create patterns to format the messages and reload the
complete logging machine.
