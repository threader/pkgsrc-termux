Gitolite is an SSH-based gatekeeper providing access control for
a server that hosts many git repositories. Without gitolite, each
developer needing to push to one of the repositories hosted would
need a user account on that server; gitolite lets you do that just
using SSH public keys tied to a single, common, user that hosts
all the repositories.

Gitolite can restrict who can read (clone/fetch) from or write
(push) to a repository, and who can push to what branch or tag -
an important issue in corporate environments. Other features include:

* access control by branch-name or by modified file/directory;
* per-developer "personal namespace" prefixes;
* simple but powerful configuration file syntax (with validation);
* config files (and authority for maintaining them) can be split;
* easy integration with gitweb;
* comprehensive logging;
* easy migration from gitosis.
