The Perl 5 module Devel::Cover provides code coverage metrics for
Perl. Code coverage metrics describe how thoroughly tests exercise
code. By using Devel::Cover you can discover areas of code not
exercised by your tests and determine which tests to create to
increase coverage. Code coverage can be considered as an indirect
measure of quality.
