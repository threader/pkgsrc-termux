RainbowDelimiters is a "rainbow parentheses"-like mode for emacs
which highlights parens, brackets, and braces according to their
depth. Each successive level is highlighted a different color. This
makes it easy to spot matching delimiters, orient yourself in the
code, and tell which statements are at the same depth.
