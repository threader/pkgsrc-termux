Parse::CPAN::Meta is a parser for META.yml files, based on the parser half
of YAML::Tiny.

It supports a basic subset of the full YAML specification, enough to implement
parsing of typical META.yml files, and other similarly simple YAML files.

If you need something with more power, move up to a full YAML parser such as
YAML, YAML::Syck or YAML::LibYAML.

Parse::CPAN::Meta provides a very simply API of only two functions, based on
the YAML functions of the same name. Wherever possible, identical calling
semantics are used.
