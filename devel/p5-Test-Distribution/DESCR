When using this module in a test script, it goes through all the modules
in your distribution, checks their POD, checks that they compile ok and
checks that they all define a $VERSION.

This module also performs a numer of test on the distribution itself. It
checks that your files match your SIGNATURE file if you have one. It
checks that your distribution isn't missing certain 'core' description
files. It checks to see you havent' missed out listing any
pre-requisites in Makefile.PL.
