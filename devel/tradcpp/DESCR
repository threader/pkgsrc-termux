tradcpp is a traditional (K&R-style) preprocessor.

It has the particular property that it doesn't (for the most part)
trash whitespace, so it can be used on makefiles.

This is release 0.5; it is still missing some features and doubtless
has quite a few bugs, but it's capable of building at least some
packages when used with imake.
