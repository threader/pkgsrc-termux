Continuous Testing is a concept and tool to re-run software tests as
soon as the developer saves the source code.

"Test::Continuous" is a tool based on App::Prove that implements this
concept for Perl.

See <http://groups.csail.mit.edu/pag/continuoustesting/> for the
original implementation of Continuous Testing as an Eclipse plugin. See
also Zentest <http://www.zenspider.com/ZSS/Products/ZenTest/> for the
same concept implemented in Ruby's world.
