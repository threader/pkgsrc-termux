This module provides you with the most commonly used testing
functions and gives you a bit more fine-grained control over your
test suite.

    use Test::Most tests => 4, 'die';

    ok 1, 'Normal calls to ok() should succeed';
    is 2, 2, '... as should all passing tests';
    eq_or_diff [3], [4], '... but failing tests should die';
    ok 4, '... will never get to here';

As you can see, the eq_or_diff test will fail. Because 'die' is in
the import list, the test program will halt at that point.
