When the code you're testing returns multiple lines, records or
data structures and they're just plain wrong, an equivalent to the
Unix diff utility may be just what's needed.

eq_or_diff_...() compares two strings or (limited) data structures
and either emits an ok indication or a side-by-side diff.
Test::Differences is designed to be used with Test.pm and with
Test::Simple, Test::More, and other Test::Builder based testing
modules. As the SYNOPSIS shows, another testing module must be used
as the basis for your test suite.

These functions assume that you are presenting it with "flat"
records, looking like:

    - scalars composed of record-per-line
    - arrays of scalars,
    - arrays of arrays of scalars,
    - arrays of hashes containing only scalars
