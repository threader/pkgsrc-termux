Many Perl distributions use a Build.PL file instead of a Makefile.PL file
to drive distribution configuration, build, test and installation.
Traditionally, Build.PL uses Module::Build as the underlying build system.
This module provides a simple, lightweight, drop-in replacement. Whereas
Module::Build has over 6,700 lines of code; this module has less than 120,
yet supports the features needed by most distributions. Supported * Pure
Perl distributions * Building XS or C * Recursive test files * MYMETA * Man
page generation * Generated code from PL files Not Supported * Dynamic
prerequisites * HTML documentation generation * Extending
Module::Build::Tiny * Module sharedirs Directory structure Your .pm and
.pod files must be in lib/. Any executables must be in script/. Test files
must be in t/. Dist sharedirs must be in share/.
