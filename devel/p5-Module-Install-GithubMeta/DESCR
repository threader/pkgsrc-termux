Module::Install::GithubMeta is a Module::Install extension to include
GitHub http://github.com meta information in META.yml.

It automatically detects if the distribution directory is under git version
control and whether the origin is a GitHub repository and will set the
repository and homepage meta in META.yml to the appropriate URLs for
GitHub.
