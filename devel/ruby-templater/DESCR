Templater has the ability to both copy files from A to B and also to render
templates using ERB. Templater consists of four parts:

- Actions (File copying routines, templates generation and directories
  creation routines).
- Generators (set of rules).
- Manifolds (generator suites).
- The command line interface.

Hierarchy is pretty simple: manifold has one or many public and private
generators. Public ones are supposed to be called by end user. Generators have
one or more action that specify what they do, where they take files, how they
name resulting files and so forth.
