autosetup is a tool, similar to autoconf, to configure a build
system for the appropriate environment, according to the system
capabilities and the user configuration.

autosetup is designed to be light-weight, fast, simple and flexible.

Notable features include:

  * Easily check for headers, functions, types for C/C++
  * Easily support user configuration options
  * Can generate files based on templates, such as Makefile.in =>
    Makefile
  * Can generate header files based on checked features
  * Excellent support for cross compilation
  * Replacement for autoconf in many situations
  * Runs with either Tcl 8.5+, Jim Tcl or just a C compiler (using
    the included Jim Tcl source code!)
  * autosetup is intended to be distributed with projects - no
    version issues
