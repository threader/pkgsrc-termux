Monotone is a free distributed version control system.  It provides a
simple, single-file transactional version store, with fully disconnected
operation and an efficient peer-to-peer synchronization protocol.  It
understands history-sensitive merging, lightweight branches, integrated
code review and 3rd party testing.  It uses cryptographic version naming
and client-side RSA certificates.  It has good internationalization
support, has no external dependencies, runs on NetBSD, Linux, Solaris,
OSX and Windows (among others), and is licensed under the GNU GPL.

This package provides the necessary stuff to configure a dedicated Monotone
server.  The package will create a dedicated user/group account to run the
server, will install a set of configuration files and will guide you, through
an rc.d script, to initialize the database and populate it.
