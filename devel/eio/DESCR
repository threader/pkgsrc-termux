Ecore is the core event abstraction layer and X abstraction layer
that makes doing selections, Xdnd, general X stuff, and event loops,
timeouts and idle handlers fast, optimized, and convenient.
It's a separate library so anyone can make use of the work put into Ecore
to make this job easy for applications.
