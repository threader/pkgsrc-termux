MooseX::MarkAsMethods allows one to easily mark certain functions as
Moose methods. This will allow other packages such as
namespace::autoclean to operate without blowing away your overloads.
After using MooseX::MarkAsMethods your overloads will be recognized by
Class::MOP as being methods, and class extension as well as
composition from roles with overloads will "just work".
