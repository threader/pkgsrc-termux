The check package builds on the standard testing library from Go to offer
a richer testing framework for libraries and applications to use.

gocheck includes features such as:
* Helpful error reporting to aid on figuring problems out (see below)
* Richer test helpers: assertions which interrupt the test immediately,
  deep multi-type comparisons, string matching, etc
* Suite-based grouping of tests
* Fixtures: per suite and/or per test set up and tear down
* Benchmarks integrated in the suite logic (with fixtures, etc)
* Management of temporary directories
* Panic-catching logic, with proper error reporting
* Proper counting of successes, failures, panics, missed tests, skips, etc
* Explicit test skipping
* Support for expected failures
* Verbosity flag which disables output caching (helpful to debug hanging
  tests, for instance)
* Multi-line string reporting for more comprehensible failures
* Inclusion of comments surrounding checks on failure reports
* Fully tested (it manages to test itself reliably)
