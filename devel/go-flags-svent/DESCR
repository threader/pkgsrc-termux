This library provides similar functionality to the builtin flag
library of go, but provides much more functionality and nicer
formatting. From the documentation:

Package flags provides an extensive command line option parser.
The flags package is similar in functionality to the go builtin
flag package but provides more options and uses reflection to
provide a convenient and succinct way of specifying command line
options.
