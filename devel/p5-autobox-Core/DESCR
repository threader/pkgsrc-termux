The Perl 5 module autobox::Core wraps perl's built-in functions for
manipulating numbers, strings, arrays, hashes, and code references.
It can be handy to use built-in functions as methods to avoid messy
dereferencing syntaxes and parentheses pile ups.

The autobox module lets you call methods in scalars that aren't
object references but perl but does not itself provide any methods
to call. That is left to the user or another module, for example,
autobox::Core.

autobox::Core is a stub module. It is merely glue, presenting
existing functions with a new interface.  Besides built-ins that
operate on hashes, arrays, scalars, and code references, some Perl
6-ish things were thrown in, and some keyword like foreach have
been turned into methods.
