The PyObjC project aims to provide a bridge between the Python and Objective-C
programming languages. The bridge is intended to be fully bidirectional,
allowing the Python programmer to take full advantage of the power provided by
various Objective-C based toolkits and the Objective-C programmer transparent
access to Python based functionality.

This package contains wrappers for frameworks 'CoreGraphics', 'ImageIO',
'QuartzCore', 'ImageKit', 'PDFKit', and 'CoreVideo'.

All frameworks can be accessed by importing the 'Quartz' module.

These wrappers don't include documentation, please check Apple's documention
for information on how to use this framework and PyObjC's documentation
for general tips and tricks regarding the translation between Python
and (Objective-)C frameworks.
