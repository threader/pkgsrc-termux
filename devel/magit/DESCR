Magit is an interface to the version control system Git, implemented as
an extension to Emacs.  Magit supports GNU Emacs version 22 or later.

With Magit, you can inspect and modify your Git repositories with Emacs.
You can review and commit the changes you have made to the tracked
files, for example, and you can browse the history of past changes.
There is support for cherry picking, reverting, merging, rebasing, and
other common Git operations.

Magit is not a complete interface to Git; it just aims to make the most
common Git operations convenient.  Thus, Magit will likely not save you
from learning Git itself.
