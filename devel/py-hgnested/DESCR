hgnested is a Mercurial extension to work with nested repositories.

It was inspired by the forest extension by Robin Farine.

The extension allows to apply common Mercurial commands to all the nested
repositories at once like pull, push etc. It also allows to fetch a complete
tree of repositories through ssh or http.

See hg help hgnested for the complete list of commands.
