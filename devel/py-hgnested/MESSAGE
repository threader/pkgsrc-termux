hgnested is a Mercurial extension to work with nested repositories.

It was inspired by the forest extension.

The extension allows to apply common Mercurial commands to all the nested
repositories at once like pull, push etc. It also allows to fetch a complete
tree of repositories through ssh or http.

To enable the "hgnested" extension, create an entry for it in your hgrc, like
this:

    [extensions]
    hgnested =

See `hg help hgnested` for the complete list of commands.
