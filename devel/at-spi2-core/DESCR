This package provides the core of the Assistive Technology Service
Provider Interface, in particular the registry daemon with which
AT applications such as screen readers can listen for events
broadcast by accessible programs; and also a library, libatspi, to
assist in writing AT applications.  This "version 2" uses DBUS
rather than CORBA for inter-application communication.
