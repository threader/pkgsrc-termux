It takes any arbitrary Perl distribution tarball (open source or otherwise)
and injects it into the local CPAN file cache, smoothing some metadata
files to make it look as if it came from CPAN.

It makes use the officially blessed "Reserved Local CPAN Author" id "LOCAL"
as the author the distributions are added under.
