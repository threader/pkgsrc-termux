NOTE: This module is mostly intended for module packaging frameworks to
share a common, up-to-date MANIFEST.SKIP base. For example,
Module::Install::ManifestSkip, uses this module to get the actual SKIP
content. However this module may be useful for any module author.

CPAN module authors use a MANIFEST.SKIP file to exclude certain well known
files from getting put into a generated MANIFEST file, which would cause
them to go into the final distribution package.

The packaging tools try to automatically skip things for you, but if you
add one of your own entries, you have to add all the common ones
yourself. This module attempts to make all of this boring process as simple
and reliable as possible.

Module::Manifest::Skip can create or update a MANIFEST.SKIP file for
you. You can add your own entries, and it will leave them alone. You can
even tell it to not skip certain entries that it normally skips, although
this is rarely needed.
