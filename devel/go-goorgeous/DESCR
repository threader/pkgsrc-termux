goorgeous is a Go Org to HTML Parser.

Pronounced: Go? Org? Yes!

    "Org mode is for keeping notes, maintaining TODO lists, planning projects,
     and authoring documents with a fast and effective plain-text system."
        orgmode.org

The purpose of this package is to come as close as possible as parsing an
*.org document into HTML, the same way one might publish with org-publish-html
from Emacs.
