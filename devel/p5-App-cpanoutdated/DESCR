The Perl 5 module App::cpanoutdated provides the script cpan-outdated
which prints a list of outdated CPAN modules in your environment.
It has the same functionality as 'CPAN::Shell->r', but cpan-outdated
is faster and uses less memory. It can be used with the cpanm
command from the App::cpanminus module.
