pathlib offers a set of classes to handle filesystem paths. It offers the
following advantages over using string objects:
 - No more cumbersome use of os and os.path functions. Everything can be done
 easily through operators, attribute accesses, and method calls
 - Embodies the semantics of different path types. For example, comparing
  Windows paths ignores casing
 - Well-defined semantics, eliminating any warts or ambiguities (forward vs
 backward slashes, etc.)
