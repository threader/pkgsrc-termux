Hypothesis is a library for testing your Python code against a much
larger range of examples than you would ever want to write by hand.
It's based on the Haskell library, Quickcheck, and is designed to
integrate seamlessly into your existing Python unit testing work
flow.

Hypothesis is both extremely practical and also advances the state
of the art of unit testing by some way. It's easy to use, stable,
and extremely powerful. If you're not using Hypothesis to test your
project then you're missing out.
