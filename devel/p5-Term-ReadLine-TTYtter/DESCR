Term::ReadLine::TTYtter is a modified version of T::RL::Perl with
several new nonstandard features specific to TTYtter, but may be useful for
other applications.

It also allows UTF-8 characters to be entered without crashing, and adds a
counter so you can see how many characters you've entered (which is a big
deal for Twitter and other microblogging platforms).
