Config::Grammar is a Perl module to parse configuration files by
following a grammar, which specifies how the configuration file should
look like. The configuration files are nice to work with for humans
and the error messages are helpful because it tells right away that
for example you are setting a variable which isn't defined.

Config::Grammar supports many advanced features, that you can read
about in its documentation (type 'man Config::Grammar' or 'perldoc
lib/Config/Grammar.pm' in this directory)
