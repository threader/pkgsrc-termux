To complete the setup you will need to read the Bugzilla-Guide.txt in order
to setup Database counter-part properly.  In particular secion 2.2.2 of the
document deals with database setup.  After the initial setup of the database
you can then check the settings in ${BZDIR}/localconfig and with super user
privilege,

	cd ${BZDIR};
	./checksetup.pl

You will need to make Bugzilla accessible through your HTTP server.
If you are running Apache then you may add the following lines to httpd.conf:

	Include ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/bugzilla.conf

to make Bugzilla accessible through:

	http://localhost/bugzilla/index.cgi

IMPORTANTLY: CHANGE YOUR DATABASE PASSWORD FROM THE DEFAULT !!
