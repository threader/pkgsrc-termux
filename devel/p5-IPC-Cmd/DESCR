IPC::Cmd allows you to run commands, interactively if desired,
platform independent but have them still work.

The can_run function can tell you if a certain binary is installed
and if so where, whereas the run function can actually execute any
of the commands you give it and give you a clear return value, as
well as adhere to your verbosity settings.
