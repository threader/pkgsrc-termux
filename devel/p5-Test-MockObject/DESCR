Perl extension for emulating troublesome interfaces.

Testing is a lot easier when you can control the entire environment.
With Test::MockObject, you can get a lot closer.

Test::MockObject allows you to create objects that conform to
particular interfaces with very little code. You don't have to
reimplement the behavior, just the input and the output.
