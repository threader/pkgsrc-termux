The Tee distribution provides the ptee program, a pure Perl emulation of the
standard GNU tool tee. It is designed to be a platform-independent
replacement for operating systems without a native tee program. As with tee,
it passes input received on STDIN through to STDOUT while also writing a copy
of the input to one or more files. By default, files will be overwritten.

Unlike tee, ptee does not support ignoring interrupts, as signal handling is
not sufficiently portable.

The Tee module provides a convenience function that may be used in place of
system() to redirect commands through ptee.
