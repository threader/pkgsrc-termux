This module provides tracking of objects, for the purpose of detecting
memory leaks due to circular references or innappropriate caching schemes.

Object tracking can be enabled on a per object basis. Any objects thus
tracked are remembered until DESTROYed; details of any objects left are
printed out to stderr at END-time.

  use Devel::Leak::Object qw(GLOBAL_bless);

This form overloads bless to track construction and destruction of all
objects. As an alternative, by importing bless, you can just track the
objects of the caller code that is doing the use.

If you use GLOBAL_bless to overload the bless function, please note that it
will ONLY apply to bless for modules loaded AFTER Devel::Leak::Object has
enabled the hook.
