PStreams allows you to run another program from your C++ application
and to transfer data between the two programs similar to shell
pipelines.

In the simplest case, a PStreams class is like a C++ wrapper for
the POSIX.2 functions popen(3) and pclose(3), using C++ iostreams
instead of C's stdio library.
