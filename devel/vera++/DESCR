Vera++ is a programmable tool for verification, analysis and
transformation of C++ source code.

Vera++ is a tool designed for programmers -- not only in the sense that
it helps with everyday development work, but also in the sense that all
its rules are implemented as scripts that can be modified or added by
the user.  Thanks to this, programmers have complete freedom and control
over what the tool does and how it works.

Vera++ is mainly an engine that parses C++ source files and presents the
result of this parsing to scripts in the form of various collections --
the scripts are actually performing the requested tasks.
