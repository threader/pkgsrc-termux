The l3kernel bundle provides an implementation of the LaTeX3
programmers' interface, as a set of packages that run under LaTeX 2e.
The interface provides the foundation on which the LaTeX3 kernel and
other future code are built: it is an API for TeX programmers. The
packages are set up so that the LaTeX3 conventions can be used with
regular LaTeX 2e packages. All the files of the bundle are also
available in the Subversion (SVN) repository of the LaTeX3 Project. The
bundle on CTAN is based on a snapshot of the SVN repository on
2011-10-09.
