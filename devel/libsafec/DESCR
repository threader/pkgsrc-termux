The Safe C Library provides bound checking memory and string functions
per ISO/IEC TR24731.  These functions are alternative functions to the
existing standard C library that promote safer, more secure
programming.

The ISO/IEC Programming languages -- C spec, C11, now includes the
bounded APIs in Appendix K, "Bounds-checking interfaces".
