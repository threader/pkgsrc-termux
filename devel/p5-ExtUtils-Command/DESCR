The Perl 5 module ExtUtils::Command is used to replace common UNIX
commands. In all cases the provided functions work from @ARGV rather
than taking arguments. This makes them easier to deal with in
Makefiles. Call them like this:
  perl -MExtUtils::Command -e some_command some files to work on
The module Shell::Command is also included in this package: it
provides the same functions but take arguments normally.
