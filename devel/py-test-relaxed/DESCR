pytest-relaxed provides 'relaxed' test discovery for pytest.

Has it ever felt strange to you that we put our tests in tests/, then name the
files test_foo.py, name the test classes TestFoo, and finally name the test
methods test_foo_bar? Especially when almost all of the code inside of tests/
is, well, tests?

This pytest plugin takes a page from the rest of Python, where you don't have
to explicitly note public module/class members, but only need to hint as to
which ones are private. By default, all files and objects pytest is told to
scan will be considered tests; to mark something as not-a-test, simply prefix
it with an underscore.
