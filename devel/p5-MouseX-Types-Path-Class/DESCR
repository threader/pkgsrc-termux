MouseX::Types::Path::Class creates common Mouse types, coercions
and option specifications useful for dealing with Path::Class objects
as Mouse attributes.

Coercions (see Mouse::Util::TypeConstraints) are made from both Str
and ArrayRef to both Path::Class::Dir and Path::Class::File objects.
If you have MouseX::Getopt installed, the Getopt option type ("=s")
will be added for both Path::Class::Dir and Path::Class::File.
