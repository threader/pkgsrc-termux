= Backports Library

* Yearning to use some of the new cool features in Ruby 2.0.0 while using
  1.8.6?
* One of your client is stuck with Ruby 1.8.6 but you want to use a gem using
  some features of 1.8.7?
* Can't remember if you can use Array#sample or String#each_char on a friend's
  box?

This gem is for you!

The goal of 'backports' is to make it easier to write ruby code that runs
across different versions of Ruby. All you need to bring any version of Ruby
up to today's standards:

  require 'backports'

This will bring in all the features of 1.8.7 (for Ruby 1.8.6) and many
features of Ruby 1.9.1 (for Ruby 1.8.x), Ruby 1.9.2 and Ruby 1.9.3 (for all
earlier versions)!

+Note+: Although I am a Ruby committer, this gem is a personal project and is
not endorsed by ruby-core.
