This module allows you to write-protect and write-enable
your Perl variables, objects and data structures.

Moreover, the reference count of any Perl variable can
be read and set.

You can never pass the object directly on which to
perform the desired action, you always have to pass
a reference to the variable or data structure in
question.

This comes in handy for objects and anonymous data
structures, where you only have a reference anyway!

BEWARE: This module is DANGEROUS!

DO NOT attempt to unlock Perl's built-in variables!

DO NOT manipulate reference counts unless you know
exactly what you're doing!

ANYTHING might happen! Hell might break loose! :-)

YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!
