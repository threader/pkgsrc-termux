Magic is Perl way of enhancing objects. This mechanism let the user
add extra data to any variable and overload syntaxical operations
(such as access, assignation or destruction) that can be applied
to it. With the module Variable::Magic , you can add your own magic
to any variable without the pain of the C API.
