Package errors provides simple error handling primitives.

The traditional error handling idiom in Go is roughly akin to

if err != nil {
        return err
}

which applied recursively up the call stack results in error reports without
context or debugging information. The errors package allows programmers to add
context to the failure path in their code in a way that does not destroy the
original value of the error.
