Curtsies is a Python 2.6+ & 3.3+ compatible library for interacting with
the terminal.

FmtStr objects are strings formatted with colors and styles displayable in
a terminal with ANSI escape sequences. FSArray objects contain multiple such
strings with each formatted string on its own row, and can be superimposed
onto each other to build complex grids of colored and styled characters.

Such grids of characters can be efficiently rendered to the terminal in
alternate screen mode (no scrollback history, like Vim, top etc.) by
FullscreenWindow objects or to the normal history-preserving screen by
CursorAwareWindow objects. User keyboard input events like pressing the up
arrow key are detected by an Input object. See the Quickstart to get started
using all of these classes.
