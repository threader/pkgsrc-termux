Test::TempDir provides temporary directory creation with testing in mind.

The differences between using this and using File::Temp are:

    * If t/tmp is available (writable, creatable, etc) it's preferred
      over $ENV{TMPDIR} etc. Otherwise a temporary directory will be
      used.
      This is temp_root
    * Lockfiles are used on t/tmp, to prevent race conditions when
      running under a parallel test harness.
    * The temp_root is cleaned at the end of a test run, but not
      if tests failed.
    * temp_root is emptied at the begining of a test run unconditionally.
    * The default policy is not to clean the individual tempfiles
      and tempdirs within temp_root, in order to aid in debugging of
      failed tests.
