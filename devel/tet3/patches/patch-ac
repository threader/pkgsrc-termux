+# NAME:		netbsd.mk
+# PRODUCT:	TETware
+# AUTHOR:	Alistair Crooks
+# DATE CREATED:	June 2003
+#
+# DESCRIPTION:
+#	Common machine-dependent definition used in makefiles.
+#	This file is included in lower level makefiles.
+#
+#	This one for NetBSD using sockets and POSIX threads.
+#	Note: this version builds the rc version of tccd.
+# 
+# MODIFICATIONS:
+# 
+# ************************************************************************
+
+# tccd can be started:
+#	from /etc/inittab (SYSV systems)
+#	from /etc/inetd (BSD4.3 style)
+#	from /etc/rc (BSD4.2 style)
+#	interactively by a user
+#
+# inittab systems should include -DINITTAB in DTET_CDEFS below
+# inetd systems should include -DINETD in DTET_CDEFS below
+# [ Not relevant for TETware-Lite ]
+
+# TCCD specifies the name by which tccd is to be known; this should be in.tccd
+# if you define INETD, otherwise it should be tccd
+# [ Not used when building TETware-Lite ]

+#	TET_CDEFS are used to compile most source files
+#	    these should include -D_POSIX_SOURCE
+#	    you may want to define TET_SIG_IGNORE and TET_SIG_LEAVE here
+#
+#	DTET_CDEFS are used to compile source files which use non-POSIX
+#	features, such as networking and threads
+#	    for example:
+#	    inet:  DTET_CDEFS = -D_ALL_SOURCE -DINETD
