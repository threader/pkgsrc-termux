Editorconfig python library. This library is used by editorconfig
plugins written in python. Editorconfig reads .editorconfig files that
define a coding style for a project. This allows the coding style to be
set by the project instead of the developer. Then the developer does not
have to change style between each project, the editor knows the coding
style of a file that belongs to a certain project.
