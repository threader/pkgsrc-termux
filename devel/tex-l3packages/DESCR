The bundle holds prototype implementations of concepts for a LaTeX
designer interface, to be used with the experimental LaTeX kernel as
programming tools and kernel support. Packages provided in this release
are: - l3keys2e, which makes the facilities of the kernel module l3keys
available for use by LaTeX 2e packages; - xfrac, which provides flexible
split-level fractions; - xparse, which provides a high-level interface
for declaring document commands; and - xtemplate, which provides a means
of defining generic functions using a key-value syntax. All the files of
the bundle are also available in the Subversion (SVN) repository of the
LaTeX3 Project. The bundle on CTAN is based on a snapshot of the SVN
repository on 2011- 10-09.
