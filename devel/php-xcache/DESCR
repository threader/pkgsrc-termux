XCache is a fast, stable PHP opcode cacher that has been proven and is now
running on production servers under high load. It is tested (on Linux) and
supported on all of the PHP release branches, such as PHP 5.1 to PHP 5.6.
ThreadSafe/Windows is also perfectly supported. XCache overcomes many of the
problems found with other opcachers such as being able to run with new PHP
versions.
