This package represents the core of the Zope Component Architecture.
Together with the 'zope.interface' package (devel/py-ZopeInterface), it
provides facilities for defining, registering and looking up components.

This package is intended to be independently reusable in any Python
project. It is maintained by the Zope Toolkit project.
