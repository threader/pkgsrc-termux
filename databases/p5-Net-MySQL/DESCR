Net::MySQL is a Pure Perl client interface for the MySQL database. This
module implements network protocol between server and client of MySQL,
thus you don't need external MySQL client library like libmysqlclient
for this module to work. It means this module enables you to connect to
MySQL server from some operation systems which MySQL is not ported.
