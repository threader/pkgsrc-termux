Ocamldap is an implementation of the Light Weight Directory Access Protocol,
and a set of useful tools built around it. It includes high level libraries for
creating ldap clients and ldap servers.

It also includes many of the auxiliary tools needed for building intelligent
solutions, and interoperating with other directories. These include, an rfc2252
schema parser, and an schema checker, an ldif parser and printer, a search
filter parser (but no printer yet), and a rudimentary ldap url parser.
