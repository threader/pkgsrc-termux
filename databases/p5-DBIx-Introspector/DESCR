DBIx::Introspector is a module factored out of the DBIx::Class
database detection code. Most code that needs to detect which
database it is connected to assumes that there is a one-to-one
mapping from database drivers to database engines. Unfortunately
reality is rarely that simple. For instance, DBD::ODBC is typically
used to connect to SQL Server, but ODBC can be used to connect
to PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Oracle. Additionally, while ODBC is the
most common way to connect to SQL Server, it is not the only option,
as DBD::ADO can also be used.
