This package brings tagging to DataMapper.  It is inspired by Acts As Taggable
On by Michael Bleigh, github's mbleigh.  Props to him for the contextual
tagging based on Acts As Taggable on Steroids.

== Features and Problems

=== Features

* Contextual tagging using Model.has_tags_on (see below for usage)
* Traditional 'tags-only' tagging using Model.has_tags

=== Problems

* None known yet, but this is very alpha software.  Sorry if it misbehaves.
  Please send me a github message if you find a bug.
