MySQL provides connectivity for client applications developed in the Java
programming language via a JDBC driver, which is called MySQL Connector/J.

MySQL Connector/J is a JDBC Type 4 driver. Different versions are available
that are compatible with the JDBC 3.0 and JDBC 4.0 specifications. The Type
4 designation means that the driver is pure-Java implementation of the MySQL
protocol and does not rely on the MySQL client libraries.

In the 5.1 version, useOldAliasMetadataBehavior is default false.
