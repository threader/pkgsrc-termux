This DBIx::Class component can be used to automatically encode a column's
contents whenever the value of that column is set.

This module is similar to the existing DBIx::Class::DigestColumns, but
there is some key differences:

DigestColumns performs the encode operation on insert and update, and
EncodedColumn performs the operation when the value is set, or on new.
DigestColumns supports only algorithms of the Digest family. EncodedColumn
employs a set of thin wrappers around different cipher modules to provide
support for any cipher you wish to use and wrappers are very simple to
write (typically less than 30 lines).
EncodedColumn supports having more than one encoded column per table
and each column can use a different cipher.
Encode adds only one item to the namespace of the object utilizing it
(_column_encoders).

There is, unfortunately, some features that EncodedColumn doesn't support.
DigestColumns supports changing certain options at runtime, as well as the
option to not automatically encode values on set. The author of this module
found these options to be non-essential and omitted them by design.
