This module implements the pure Perl client which connects to the server of
Tokyo Tyrant and speaks its original binary protocol.

Tokyo Tyrant is a package of network interface to the DBM called Tokyo Cabinet.
Though the DBM has high performance, you might bother in case that multiple
processes share the same database, or remote processes access the database.
Thus, Tokyo Tyrant is provided for concurrent and remote connections to Tokyo
Cabinet. It is composed of the server process managing a database and its access
library for client applications. The server can embed Lua, a lightweight script
language so that you can define arbitrary operations of the database.

The server features high concurrency due to thread-pool modeled implementation
and the epoll/kqueue mechanism of the modern Linux/*BSD kernel. The server and
its clients communicate with each other by simple binary protocol on TCP/IP.
Protocols compatible with memcached and HTTP/1.1 are also supported so that
almost all principal platforms and programming languages can use Tokyo Tyrant.
High availability and high integrity are also featured due to such mechanisms as
hot backup, update logging, and replication.
