tokyocabinet aims to be a complete python wrapper for the ass-kicking
Tokyo Cabinet database library by Mikio Hirabayashi
(http://1978th.net/). While there are other wrappers out there none
were found to be comprehensive enough. At present, the btree, hash and
table APIs are available as hand-written C extensions.

A similar effort is underway for the Tokyo Tyrant client API here:

Omissions, bugs, patches and feedback are greatly welcome. This
package is written and maintained by Elisha Cook.
