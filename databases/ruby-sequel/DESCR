Sequel is a database access toolkit for Ruby.  Sequel provides thread
safety, connection pooling, and a concise DSL for constructing queries
and table schemas.

Sequel makes it easy to deal with multiple records without having to
break your teeth on SQL.

This package contains model classes for Sequel that allow it to be used
as an object-relational mapping (ORM).
