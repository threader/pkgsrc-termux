ose::DBx::Garden bootstraps Rose::DB::Object and Rose::HTML::Form
based projects. The idea is that you can point the module at a
database and end up with work-able RDBO and Form classes with a
single method call.

Rose::DBx::Garden inherits from Rose::DB::Object::Loader, so all
the magic there is also available here.
