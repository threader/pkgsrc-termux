Lua-Sqlite3 is a binding of Sqlite3 for Lua.

Lua-Sqlite3 is unique in contrast to other database bindings that it consists
of two layers. The first layer translates the SQLite 3 implementation's C API
to Lua. The first layer is called the backend. The second layers are frontend
layers, written in Lua. These layers provide a nice and smart view of the
database

Currently, Lua-Sqlite3 implements two frontends:
* A specialiced frontend which provides all sqlite3 capabilities.
* A LuaSQL compatible frontend as used on the Kepler Project.
