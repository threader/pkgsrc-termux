This module parses a query string into a data structure to be
handled by external search engines. For examples of such engines,
see File::Tabular and Search::Indexer.

The query string can contain simple terms, "exact phrases", field
names and comparison operators, '+/-' prefixes, parentheses, and
boolean connectors.
