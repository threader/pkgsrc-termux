ldap3 is a strictly RFC 4510 conforming LDAP v3 pure Python client library.
The whole ldap3 library has been written from scratch and the same codebase
works with Python 2, Python 3, PyPy and PyPy3 on any system where it can gain
access to the network via a Python interpreter and the Python Standard Library.
