CatalystX::CRUD provides a simple and generic API for Catalyst CRUD
applications. CatalystX::CRUD is agnostic with regard to data model
and data input, instead providing a common API that different
projects can implement for greater compatability with one another.

The project was born out of a desire to make Rose::HTML::Objects
easy to use with Rose::DB::Object and DBIx::Class ORMs, using the
Catalyst::Controller::Rose project. However, any ORM could implement
the CatalystX::CRUD::Model API, and any form management project
could use the resulting CatalystX::CRUD::Model subclass.
