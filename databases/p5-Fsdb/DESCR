FSDB is package of commands for manipulating flat-ASCII databases from
shell scripts.  FSDB is useful to process medium amounts of data (with
very little data you'd do it by hand, with megabytes you might want a
real database).

Fsdb was known as Jdb from 1991 to Oct. 2008.

Fsdb is very good at doing things like:

	- extracting measurements from experimental output
	- re-examining data to address different hypotheses
	- joining data from different experiments
	- eliminating/detecting outliers
	- computing statistics on data (mean, confidence intervals,
		correlations, histograms)
	- reformatting data for graphing programs

Rather than hand-code scripts to do each special case, FSDB provides
higher-level functions.  Although it's often easy throw together a
custom script to do any single task, I believe that there are several
advantages to using this library: it is higher-level than raw perl,
control uses names intead of column numbers, it is self-documenting,
and it is very robust (error cases, careful memory handling, etc.).
