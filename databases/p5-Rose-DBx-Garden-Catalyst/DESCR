Rose::DBx::Garden::Catalyst extends Rose::DBx::Garden to create
Catalyst components that use the RDBO and RHTMLO classes that the
Garden class produces.

By default this class creates stub Template Toolkit files for use
with the RDBO and RHTMLO CRUD components. If you use a different
templating system, just set the tt option to 0.
