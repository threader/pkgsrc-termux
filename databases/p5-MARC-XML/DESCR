The MARC-XML distribution is an extension to the MARC-Record distribution for
working with MARC21 data that is encoded as XML. The XML encoding used is the
MARC21slim schema supplied by the Library of Congress. More information may be
obtained here: http://www.loc.gov/standards/marcxml/

This version of MARC-XML supersedes an the versions ending with 0.25 which were
used with the MARC.pm framework. MARC-XML now uses MARC::Record exclusively.
