This module is similar to MLDBM except that it stores data internally as
YAML, instead of Data::Dumper or Storable. By doing this, tied hash DBM
databases can be created that can be used seamlessly in Python or Ruby
applications. That's because those languages also have YAML and DBM
modules. As other languages get YAML support, YAML::MLDBM should be able
to be used with them as well.

This module is a wrapper around MLDBM, but you open a DBM file using the
new() method, instead of using a tie. new() will return a reference to
a tied hash.

You can also use YAML as a serialization method for MLDBM itself.
