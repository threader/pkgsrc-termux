DBIx::Class::Loader automates the definition of DBIx::Class
sub-classes by scanning table schemas and setting up columns and
primary keys.

This module is deprecated in favor of DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader
for use with DBIx::Class versions 0.05 and higher. It continues to
function as well as it ever did, even for recent DBIx::Class
releases, and will be maintained for some time to counter bugs,
but it doesn't use the now-preferred DBIx::Class::Schema way of
doing things, and tends to promote bad DBIx::Class usage habits.
