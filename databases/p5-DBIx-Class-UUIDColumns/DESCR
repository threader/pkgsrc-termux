This DBIx::Class component resembles the behaviour of Class::DBI::UUID,
to make some columns implicitly created as uuid.

When loaded, UUIDColumns will search for a suitable uuid generation
module from the following list of supported modules:

    Data::UUID APR::UUID* UUID Win32::Guidgen Win32API::GUID

If no supporting module can be found, an exception will be thrown.

*APR::UUID will not be loaded under OpenBSD due to an as yet
unidentified XS issue.
