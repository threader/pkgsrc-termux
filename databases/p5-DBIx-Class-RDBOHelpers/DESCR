DBIx::Class::RDBOHelpers implements several methods with the same
names as those in Rose::DBx::Object::MoreHelpers. This class helps
ease compatability issues when using packages that expect these
methods to exist, like Rose::HTMLx::Form::Related and CatalystX::CRUD::YUI.
Most of these are convenience wrappers rather than implementing
any new features.
