Rose::DBx::AutoReconnect is a subclass of Rose::DB. Additional
features include:

    * If using new_or_cached() method, will ping() dbh on every
      fetch from cache to ensure that the dbh is connected. This
      extends the basic Rose::DB::Cache behaviour beyond
      mod_perl/Apache::DBI.
    * Convenient logger() method for debugging.
    * Always uses DBI connect_cached() method when creating handles.

Rose::DBx::AutoReconnect was written to allow new_or_cached() to
work with MySQL's "morning bug" and to allow for restarting your
database without restarting your application. See also
Rose::DBx::Cache::Anywhere.
