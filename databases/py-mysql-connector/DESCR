MySQL Connector/Python enables Python programs to access MySQL databases, using
an API that is compliant with the Python DB API version 2.0. It is written in
pure Python and does not have any dependencies except for the Python Standard
Library.

MySQL Connector/Python includes support for:
* Almost all features provided by MySQL Server up to and including MySQL Server
  version 5.5.
* Converting parameter values back and forth between Python and MySQL data
  types, for example Python datetime and MySQL DATETIME. You can turn automatic
  conversion on for convenience, or off for optimal performance.
* All MySQL extensions to standard SQL syntax.
* Protocol compression, which enables compressing the data stream between the
  client and server.
* Connections using TCP/IP sockets and on Unix using Unix sockets.
* Secure TCP/IP connections using SSL.
* Self-contained driver. Connector/Python does not require the MySQL client
  library or any Python modules outside the standard library.
