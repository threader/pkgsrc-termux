This plugin provides a SQL::Abstract search method for Class::DBI.
It is similar to Class::DBI::AbstractSearch, but allows you to
search and sort by fields from joined tables.

Note: When searching and sorting by the fields of the current class
only, it is more efficient to use Class::DBI::AbstractSearch.
