Do *not* edit "${CONF_INC_PHP}" to customize
this package because it is a link which will removed during upgrades.
The actual configuration file is "${PMCONFFILE}".

You will need to make phpMyAdmin accessible through your HTTP server.
If you are running Apache and ap-php, then you can add the following line
to httpd.conf:

	Include ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/apache.conf

to make phpMyAdmin accessible through:

	http://www.example.com/phpmyadmin/

If you are setting up phpmyadmin for the first time you will need to
comment out the configuration block in your apache.conf which denies
access to the scripts directory.  This only need to be done the first
time you access your phpmyadmin installation.
