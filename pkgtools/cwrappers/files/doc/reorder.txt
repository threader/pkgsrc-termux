The fourth phase of the wrapper processing can reorder libraries
according to platform specific dependencies.  Each rule has the
form "l:lib1:lib2".  It ensures that all -llib1 options before -llib2
are moved directly after the latter.

The rules are processed in order to all arguments at once.  Cycle
reorder rules effectively result in the last rule winning.

The reorder rules may interact badly with -Wl,-Bdynamic and
-Wl,-Bstatic.  If this options are in use, the correct ordering
should be used without depending on the wrapper.
