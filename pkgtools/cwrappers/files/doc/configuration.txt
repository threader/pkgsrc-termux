$NetBSD: configuration.txt,v 1.3 2017/06/11 19:34:44 joerg Exp $

The configuration of the wrapper framework depends on two variables.
The environment variable CWRAPPERS_CONFIG_DIR points to a directory
with one configuration file per wrapper.

The configuration file consists of simple key=value pairs.  It is
case-sensitive and all spaces are considered part of the value.

Lists of keys:

worklog: Name of logfile to append to.

exec: Name of the target command to exec(2).

path: Override current value of the environmental variable PATH before
calling the wrappee.

reorder: Specify a reorder rule.  See reorder.txt for the details.

transform: Specify a transformation rule.  See generic-transform.txt for
the details.

prepend: Prepend an option directly after logging the original command.
The options are inserted in the order of the config file. In libtool mode,
the options are inserted after the first argument, if that argument itself is
not an option.

append: Append an option directly after logging the original command.
The options are inserted in the order of the config file.

prepend_executable: Like prepend, but applied only if the operation mode is
link-executable.

append_executable: Like append, but applied only if the operation mode is
link-executable.

prepend_shared: Like prepend, but applied only if the operation mode is
link-shared.

append_shared: Like append, but applied only if the operation mode is
link-shared.
