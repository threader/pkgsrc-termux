The fifth phase of the wrapper processing is the platform
transformation support.  The aim here is to translate GCC
options (and some other compiler frontends) into the options
of the target compiler.

Translations for GCC are:
- Drop "-w"
- Translate "-mt" to "-threads", "-64" to "-m64" and
  "-Kpic", "-kpic", "-KPIC" and "-kPIC" to "-fPIC".

It can warn about options during translation as well.
