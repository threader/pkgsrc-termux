The first phase of wrapper processing for ld-ish wrappers is argument
normalisation.  This simplifies processing in latter steps.

Transformations done in this phase:

1. Empty arguments are suppressed.

2. Arguments of the "-Wl,foo" are converted to "foo".

3. Arguments of the form "-L foo" are converted to the single argument
form "-Lfoo".

7. Arguments of the form "-Rfoo", "-R foo" or "--rpath foo" are converted
to the form "-rpath foo".

8. Full path names that end up in
"/lib([a-zA-Z0-9_-])*\.s[ol](\.[0-9][^/]*)$ are replaced by "-Ldir -l\1"
with "dir" being the base name of the argument.  This is not done for
arguments to -o, --dynamic-linker or -Wl,--dynamic-linker.

If "-shared" or "-Bshareable" is present, the operation mode is considered
to be link-shared, otherwise the output mode is link-executable.
