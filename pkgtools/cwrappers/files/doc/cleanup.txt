$NetBSD: cleanup.txt,v 1.1 2014/09/17 12:40:56 joerg Exp $

The second phase of wrapper processing for cc-ish wrappers is removal of
broken or redundant arguments.  This helps platforms with small argv
limit.  The cleanup phase is repeated after all other transformations
are done.

Transformations done in this phase:

1. Remove rpath options with relative path.  This is just a bug and they
should never end up in the final binary.  -Wl,-rpath-link is not dropped
as it only affects the linker.

2. Unify consecutive identical -l options.

3. Drop duplicate -I, -L, -Wl,-rpath and -Wl,-rpath-link.
