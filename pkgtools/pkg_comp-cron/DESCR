This package sets up periodic builds of binary packages using the
pkgtools/pkg_comp utility given minimal configuration.  All that is
needed from the user is to determine which packages to build
automatically.

If you are on NetBSD, see also sysutils/sysbuild-user, which is the
perfect companion to this package to periodically build the base system.
