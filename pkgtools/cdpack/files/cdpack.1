.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op -dnRVv
.Op -ac | -ec
.Op -af | -ef
.Op -dvd
.Op -h | --help
.Op -l logfile
.Op -m machine_architecture
.Op -o operating_system

.Op -X extras_directory
.Op -x common_directory
.Ar packages_directory
.Ar cd_image_directory
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility produces ISO 9660 image files for
a multiple CD/DVD collection of binary packages.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility extracts the dependency information from the binary
packages in the directory
.Ar packages_directory
specified on the command line.
The dependency information is
used to determine which packages are placed on which CD/DVD.
The directory
.Ar cd_image_directory
is used as a staging area and the final ISO 9660 images are left in
that directory.
A file,
.Pa .index ,
which lists the contents of each CD/DVD will be left in the root
directory of each CD/DVD image.
.Nm
will look for files ending both in
.Pa .tgz
as well as
.Pa .tbz
when scanning the directory
.Ar packages_directory
for binary packages.
.Bl -tag -width "-x directory "
.It Fl ac
Include binary packages marked as
.Dv NO_BIN_ON_CDROM
on the CD/DVD set.
The default is to omit any packages which were marked as
.Dv NO_BIN_ON_CDROM .
This option should
only be used when making a CD/DVD set for personal use and not for
distribution unless you are sure you have not violated any licenses.
.It Fl af
Include binary packages marked as
.Dv NO_BIN_ON_FTP
on the CD/DVD set.
This option is enabled by default.
.It Fl d
Enable debugging by not deleting temporary files at the end of the
run.
These files are left in
.Ev TMPDIR .
.It Fl dvd
Create DVD sized images rather than the default CD-ROM sized images.
.It Fl ec
Exclude packages marked as
.Dv NO_BIN_ON_CDROM
from the CD/DVD set.
This is the default.
.It Fl ef
Exclude packages marked as
.Dv NO_BIN_ON_FTP
from the CD/DVD set.
The default is to allow packages which are
.Dv NO_BIN_ON_FTP .
.It Fl h
.It Fl Fl help
Displays a short usage message.
.It Fl l Ar logfile
Log the output of
.Ic mkisofs Fl v Fl v
to the file
.Ar logfile .
.It Fl m Ar machine_architecture
Specifies
.Ar machine_architecture
as the target architecture for the binary packages in the generated
README file.
.It Fl n
Do not duplicate packages in order to prevent inter-CD/DVD dependencies.
The default without the
.Fl n
option will place a package and all of its dependencies on the same
CD/DVD.
If a particular package is also required by pacakges on other
CD/DVD's, it will be placed there as well.
When the
.Fl n
option is used packages are not duplicated.
This results in slightly smaller ISO 9660 images.
.Nm
places packages which are lower in the dependency tree on lower
numbered CD/DVD's and packages which are higher on the higher numbered
CD/DVD's.
In this fashion, a package on CD/DVD number n
will have all of its dependencies on CD/DVD numbers 1 through n
.It Fl o Ar operating_system
Specifies
.Ar operating_system
as the target operating system for the binary packages in the
generated README file.
.It Fl R
Generate a file,
.Pa README.txt ,
which will be placed in the root directory of each CD/DVD image.
This README file contains a small amount of information about the contents
of the CD/DVD set.
.It Fl r Ar os_version
Specifies
.Ar os_version
as the target operating system version for the binary packages in
the generated README file.
.It Fl V
Print the program version number and exit.
.It Fl v
Be verbose.
Currently does not change things much.
.It Fl X Ar directory
Includes the contents of
.Ar directory
on the last CD/DVD in the set.
This is useful for adding
a pkgsrc.tar.gz tarball, i.e. a file which does not
need to be on each CD/DVD.
.It Fl x Ar directory
Includes the contents of
.Ar directory
on each CD/DVD.
This is useful for README files, etc., which you want
to be present on each CD/DVD in the set.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std cdpack
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Nm
uses the fillowing environment variables if set.
.Bl -tag -width "TMPDIR"
.It Ev AWK
awk implementation to use.
Defaults to
.Dq Pa @AWK@ .
.It Ev BZCAT
bzcat implementation to use.
Defaults to
.Dq Pa @BZCAT@ .
.It Ev GZCAT
gzcat implementation to use.
Defaults to
.Dq Pa @GZCAT@ .
.It Ev TMPDIR
Directory for holding temporary files during the image creation.
Defaults to
.Dq Pa /tmp .
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
This example takes all of the binary packages found in
.Pa /usr/pkgsrc/packages/All
and creates cd images in
.Pa /u2/cdimages/cd{1,2,...}.iso .
The directories
.Pa /u2/cdimages/cd{1,2,...}
are used to create the ISO 9660 layouts.
.D1 cdpack /usr/pkgsrc/packages/All /u2/cdimages
.Pp
To include a common set of files on all CD/DVD's, place them in a
directory,
.Pa /tmp/foo
in this example, and pass in the directory name
with the
.Fl x
option.
.Dl cdpack -x /tmp/foo /usr/pkgsrc/packages/All /u2/cdimages

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility first appeared in the
.Nx
packages collection in April, 2001.
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
utility was written by
.An Dan McMahill
.Aq dmcmahill@NetBSD.org .
The
idea of duplicating packages to eliminate inter-CD/DVD dependencies
came from
.An Todd Vierling
.Aq tv@NetBSD.org .
