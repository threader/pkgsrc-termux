     ppaattcchhddiiffff is a perl script that simplifies comparing a set of previously
     existing patches with a new one created with mkpatches(1).

     ppaattcchhddiiffff must be called from the package's main directory, that is
     _$_{_P_K_G_S_R_C_}_/_c_a_t_e_g_o_r_y_/_p_r_o_g_r_a_m.  For each patch existing in either the
     _p_a_t_c_h_e_s directory, it is compared with its backup file (_p_a_t_c_h_-_f_o_o_._o_r_i_g)
     using diff(1).  If no relevant differences are found, the original patch
     is restored.
