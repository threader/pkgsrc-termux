Hi!

below you will find some patches against $pkgname that are
currently part of the NetBSD Packages Collection, pkgsrc, to get your
software build properly on NetBSD and maybe some other platforms. We'd
be pleased if you could include as much of these patches into your next
release as possible, thanks!

FWIW, your software has a webpage at the NetBSD site, see

	http://www.NetBSD.org/packages/$pkg/README.html

See http://www.NetBSD.org/docs/software/packages.html
to learn more about the NetBSD Packages Collection, to find out
more about the NetBSD operating system, see http://www.NetBSD.org/.
