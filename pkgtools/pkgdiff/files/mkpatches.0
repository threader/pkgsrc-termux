     mmkkppaattcchheess is a perl script that simplifies creating patches from a
     changed work tree if for each changed file the original was kept with an
     added extension ``.orig''.

     mmkkppaattcchheess must be called from the package's main directory, that is
     _$_{_P_K_G_S_R_C_}_/_c_a_t_e_g_o_r_y_/_p_r_o_g_r_a_m.  It then proceeds to find all files that
     match the pattern ``*.orig''.  Each of these is then compared to the
     changed file of the same name (with no ``.orig'' extension) using
     pkgdiff(1).

     The resulting patches are saved in the package's patches directory (usu-
     ally _p_a_t_c_h_e_s_/) and can be easily compared to the currently existing set
     using patchdiff(1) or ccvvss ddiiffff.

     Supported options are:

     --cc   Clean up backup patches of previous runs.  Use this after you're
          finished working on the patch set and committed it.

     --hh   Show a short usage.

     --rr   Revert the changes.  Removes the new patches and puts the original
          patches back.

     --vv   More verbose output.
