.Sh NAME
.Nm patchdiff
.Nd compare sets of patches
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl D | Fl d Ar dir
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a perl script that simplifies comparing a set of previously
existing patches with a new one created with
.Xr mkpatches 1 .
.Pp
.Nm
must be called from the package's main directory, that is
.Pa ${PKGSRC}/category/program .
For each patch existing in either the
.Pa patches
directory, it is compared with its backup file
.Pq Pa patch-foo.orig
using
.Xr diff 1 .
.Pp
If the
.Fl d
option is used,
.Nm
looks for patches in
.Ar dir
instead of the default
.Pa patches
directory.
If the
.Fl D
option is used,
.Nm
looks in
.Pa $WRKDIR/.newpatches .
