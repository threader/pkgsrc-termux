This is a dummy-package which is made a dependence for packages which are
tightly bound to a specific version of an operating system, e.g. LKMs or
sysutils/lsof. Such binary packages are not backwards compatible with other
versions of the OS.

The version number of this package should be similar to the operating system
version (`uname -r' output).
