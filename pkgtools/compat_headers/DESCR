This package attempts to resolve deficiencies in system headers by
providing missing types, definitions and prototypes in shadow headers.

When use of compat_headers has been enabled on a platform, this package will
become a compile-time dependency for every package. It will provide customized
header files that take preference over some system provided ones (that may
not even exist). This happens transparently through use of buildlink3.

To enable use of this package, set FIX_SYSTEM_HEADERS=yes in mk.conf.
