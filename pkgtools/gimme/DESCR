Sometimes, there's a need to just build a package without any of the
installed pre-requisites being used. Or building a one-off package
which can then be used elsewhere.

This package helps to produce other binary packages, using pkg_comp to
build them in a chroot.  The chroot is populated either by cloning the
current operating system, or by using pre-existing binary sets.  As an
example:

	# gimme -c vip

will clone the current operating system on this host, and use it to
make a chroot in which the sysutils/vip package will be built.

Similarly, to build packages and all their pre-requisites afresh,
something like

	# gimme -c mercurial git-base

would be used.
