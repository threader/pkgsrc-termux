.Sh NAME
.Nm gimme
.Nd script to build binary packages in a chroot
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl cv
.Op Fl d Ar distribdir
.Ar package ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
uses
.Xr pkg_comp
to manage a chroot environment in which binary packages can
be built easily.
Pre-existing binary sets can be used, or a clone of the
operating system in the current environment can be used.
.Pp
To use a clone of the current operating system in the chroot,
the
.Fl c
argument is used.
Alternatively, one can use pre-existing sets, which will
be taken from the directory specified by the
.Fl d
argument.
.Pp
Packages can be specified by the one-word base name of the
package, like
.Dq mercurial
or by specifying the category and directory name, like
.Dq devel/mercurial .
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility will return 0 for a successful verification,
1 if the file's signature does not match what was expected,
or 2 if any other error occurs.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr pkg_comp 1
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command first appeared in
.Nx 8.0 .
