distbb - distributed bulk build tool for pkgsrc

Key features:
   - several packages can be built at the same time on different
        machines or chroots
   - good design ;-)
   - flexibility
   - compactness
   - no limit on a number of "slave" machines and/or chroots
   - fault tolerance, e.g. failures of slave hosts is not a problem
   - nice logging
