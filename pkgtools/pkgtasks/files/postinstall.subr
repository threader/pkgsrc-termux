# NAME
#	postinstall.subr -- post-installation actions for packages
#
# SYNOPSIS
#	task_postinstall <datafile>
#
# DESCRIPTION
#	The task_postinstall function performs actions that SHOULD occur
#	AFTER the package files are installed into their final location
#	for the installation:
#
#	    o Copy configuration files into correct locations.
#	    o Set special permissions on package files and directories.
#	    o Rebuild the system run-time library search path database.
#	    o Update fonts databases.
#	    o Create caches within GTK+ icon theme directories.
#	    o Register shells in the system shells database.
#	    o Register GNU info files.
#	    o Update OCaml module run-time library search path database.
#
#	The datafile contains lines of the form:
#
#	    # <keyword>: <arg> ...
#
#	These lines are used as input to the various script functions.
#
# RETURN VALUES
#	Returns 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
#
# ENVIRONMENT
#	The following variables are used if they are set:
#
#	TASK_VERBOSE
#		List of package tasks that should emit verbose output.
#		If ${TASK_VERBOSE} is "all", then all tasks are verbose.
#		If ${TASK_VERBOSE} is "none", then no tasks are verbose.
#		Otherwise, if one of the tasks is "default", then the
#		default list of tasks are verbose.
#
