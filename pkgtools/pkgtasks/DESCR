pkgtasks is a shell script library to ease writing POSIX-compliant shell
scripts to handle common tasks during installation or removal of a
package, e.g.,

  * creating groups and users needed by the package

  * creating and removing directories with special permissions and
    ownership,

  * copying example config files to their final locations during package
    installation, and removing them during package removal if they don't
    differ from the example ones,

  * reminding the user of files that may be customized after package
    installation.
