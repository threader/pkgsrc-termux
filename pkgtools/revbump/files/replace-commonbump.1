.Dt REPLACE-COMMONBUMP 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm replace-commonbump
.Nd tool to help expanding (replacing) commonbump file to the real list of Makefiles
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl ah
.Op Fl p Ar pkgsrcdir
.Op Fl T Ar list_file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a perl script for pkgsrc developers.
It simplifies the process expanding
.Pa commonbump
file into
.Pa commonbump-replace .
The
.Pa commonbump
file is to be created by the first stage of the
.Dv PKGREVISION
bump process as described in
.Xr revbump 1 .
.Pp
.Nm Fl h
displays a short usage.
.Pp
If
.Fl p
is given,
.Ar pkgsrcdir
is used instead of the default
.Pa /usr/pkgsrc .
.Pp
If
.Fl a
is given,
check the whole pkgsrc tree, disregard both the
.Fl T
option and the default
.Pa commonbump
file.
It will check if
.Dq # used by
is included or not, usually in Makefile.common in the package.
.Pp
If
.Fl T
is given,
.Ar list_file
is used instead of the default
.Pa commonbump .
.Pp
.Nm
prints the package name
(in
.Ar category/package
form) on stdout for each package where it failed, but usually none.
.Pp
The internal process is divided into three stages.
.Bl -enum
.It
Read entire pkgsrc tree and check the
.Ar referer -> referenced
relation,
then internally keeps (opposite)
.Ar referenced -> referer
relation table.
.It
Read a file, named
.Pa commonbump
or the argument given with
.Fl T ,
which usually lists
.Pa Makefile.common
or
.Pa *common.mk
files to be expanded.
.It
Expand the filenames listed in
.Pa commonbump
into the list of packagename/Makefile by the
referenced -> referer relation.
.Nm
then outputs to the file
.Pa commonbump.replaced
(currently the name is fixed).
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Ev PKGSRCDIR
pkgsrc root directory.
Defaults to
.Pa /usr/pkgsrc .
