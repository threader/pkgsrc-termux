.Sh NAME
.Nm revbump
.Nd tool to help bump PKGREVISIONs automatically
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl h
.Op Fl p Ar pkgsrcdir
.Op cat1/pkg1 ... catN/pkgN
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a perl script for pkgsrc developers that simplifies bumping
PKGREVISIONs automatically.
Given a package (in
.Ar category/package
format) on the command line or stdin, it will try to increase
the PKGREVISION for that package automatically.
.Pp
.Nm Fl h
displays a short usage.
.Pp
If
.Fl p
is given,
.Ar pkgsrcdir
is used instead of the default
.Pa /usr/pkgsrc .
.Pp
.Nm
reports successful updates on stdout, and prints the package name
(in
.Ar category/package
form) on stdout for each package where it failed.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Dl revbump devel/gmake x11/glib2
.Pp
would bump the PKGREVISIONs of gmake and glib2, as would
.Bd -literal -offset indent
revbump \*[Lt]\*[Lt] EOF
devel/gmake
x11/glib2
EOF
.Ed
.Pp
The complete procedure for a recursive dependency bump for
category/package using
.Nm
and
.Xr blbump 1
would be:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
cd /usr/pkgsrc ;
finddepends category/package | sort -u \*[Gt] allbump ;
grep buildlink3.mk allbump | sed 's/.buildlink3.mk//' \*[Gt] bl3bump ;
grep -e Makefile.common -e mk$ allbump | grep -v -e buildlink3.mk -e options.mk > commonbump ;
replace-commonbump ;
cat allbump commonbump.replaced | sed 's,/[^/]*$,,' | sort -u \*[Gt] makebump ;
revbump \*[Lt] makebump | tee makebump.manual ;
# [if a package is listed in makebump.manual, handle the PKGREVISION bump manually]
blbump \*[Lt] bl3bump | tee bl3bump.manual ;
# [handle the *ABI_DEPENDS* bumps in bl3bump.manual manually, usually none] ;
cvs diff -u `cat makebump` > cvs-diff ;
check-cvs-diff  ;
cvs diff `cat bl3bump makebump` | less
cvs commit `cat bl3bump makebump`
rm allbump bl3bump* makebump* commonbump* cvs-diff
.Ed
Please note that for
.Pa lang/perl5
it is recommended to additionally bump all packages called
.Pa p5-*
and every package using perl, i.e.
.Dl grep -r perl /usr/pkgsrc
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Ev PKGSRCDIR
pkgsrc root directory.
Defaults to
.Pa /usr/pkgsrc .
