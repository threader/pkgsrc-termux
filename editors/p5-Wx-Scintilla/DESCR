Scintilla is a contributed project which means it will not be the latest
by the time a new wxWidgets distribution is released. And on the scintilla
front, the Perl 5 lexer is not 100% bug free even and we do not have any
kind of Perl 6 support in Scintilla.

The ambitious goal of this project is to provide fresh Perl 5 and maybe 6
support in Wx while preserving compatibility with Wx::StyledTextCtrl and
continually contribute it back to Scintilla project.
