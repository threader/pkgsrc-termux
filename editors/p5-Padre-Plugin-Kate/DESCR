This plugin provides an interface to the Syntax::Highligh::Engine::Kate
which implements syntax highlighting rules taken from the Kate editor.

Currently the plugin only implements Perl 5 and PHP highlighting.

Once this plug-in is installed the user can switch the highlighting of
all Perl 5 or PHP files to use this highlighter via the Preferences menu
of Padre.
