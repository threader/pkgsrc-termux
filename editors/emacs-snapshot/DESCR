features of GNU Emacs include:

- Content-sensitive editing modes, including syntax coloring, for a
  wide variety of file types including plain text, source code, and
  HTML.
- Complete built-in documentation, including a tutorial for new users.
- Support for many languages and their scripts, including all scripts,
  Russian, Greek, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Thai, Vietnamese, Lao,
  Ethiopian, and some Indian scripts.
- Highly customizable, using Emacs Lisp code or a graphical
  customization interface.
- A large number of extensions that add other functionality, including
  a project planner, mail and news reader, debugger interface,
  calendar, and more.  Many of these extensions are distributed with
