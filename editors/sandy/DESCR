Sandy is an ncurses text editor with an easy-to-read, hackable C source. Sandy
tries to maximize screen estate, minimize the SLOC used and not get in your way
too much. It can somehow be controlled using a named pipe that lives in /tmp and
all preferences and keybindings are to be chosen at compile time.
