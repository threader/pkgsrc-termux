Hexcurse is an ncurses-based hex editing utility that can open, edit and save
files, editing both the hexadecimal and decimal values.

It currently supports searching, hex and decimal address output, jumping to
specified locations in the file, "undo" capabilities, "bolded" modifications,
EBCDIC mode, and quick keyboard shortcuts to commands.
