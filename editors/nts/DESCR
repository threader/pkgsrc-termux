nts is an acronym for Note Taking Simplified. It provides a simple,
intuitive format for using plain text files to store notes, a
command line interface for viewing notes in a variety of convenient
ways and a cross-platform, wx(python)-based GUI for creating and
modifying notes as well as viewing them. Displayed items can be
grouped by path or tag and can be filtered in various ways.
