Jedi is a static analysis tool for Python that can be used in IDEs/editors. Its
historic focus is autocompletion, but does static analysis for now as well.
Jedi is fast and is very well tested. It understands Python on a deeper level
than all other static analysis frameworks for Python.

Jedi has support for two different goto functions. It's possible to search for
related names and to list all names in a Python file and infer them. Jedi
understands docstrings and you can use Jedi autocompletion in your REPL as
well.
