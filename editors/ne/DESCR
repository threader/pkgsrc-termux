NE is a text editor that was originally designed to run on a wide
variety of machines, from large servers to personal workstations.
In the past it ran on a number of operating systems; however, the
current version supports only Unix-like systems.

The main use of NE is expected to be as an interactive screen
editor.  However, it can also function as a line-by-line editor,
and it is programmable, so it can be run non-interactively as a
text manipulation tool.

NE is a re-implementation of a previous editor that was called E,
which in turn evolved from one called Zed and a number of predecessors
that ran on IBM mainframes. The lineage can be traced back to some
very early Cambridge text editors of the 1960s.
