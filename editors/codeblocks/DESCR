Code::Blocks is a free C++ IDE built to meet the most demanding needs of its
users. It is designed to be very extensible and fully configurable.

Finally, an IDE with all the features you need, having a consistent look, feel
and operation across platforms.

Built around a plugin framework, Code::Blocks can be extended with plugins. Any
kind of functionality can be added by installing/coding a plugin. For instance,
compiling and debugging functionality is already provided by plugins!
