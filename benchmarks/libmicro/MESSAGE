Execute "run-libmicro" to run the benchmark.

You can pipe the output of "run-libmicro" to a file, and process it later
via "multiview" when you need to generate an HTML report.

For example, suppose you want to compare two runs. You can do:

$ run-libmicro > output.1
$ run-libmicro > output.2
$ multiview output.1 output.2 > comparison.html

Then read 'comparison.html' in your favorite web browser.

WARNING: libMicro's results are strongly dependant of compile time options
and compiler's optimizations. You must ensure that the compiler does
not arbitrarily chose optimizations that do not fit the benchmark, or
which may return irrelevant results. For example: over-simplification of
the call-graph, load/store variables from register instead of memory,
function vs builtin macro expansion, ...
