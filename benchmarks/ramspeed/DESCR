RAMspeed, a cache and memory benchmarking tool
(for uniprocessor machines running UNIX-like operating systems).

This command line utility measures effective bandwidth of both cache and memory
subsystems. It has been written entirely in C for portability purposes, though
benchmark routines are also available in several assembly languages for
performance reasons.
