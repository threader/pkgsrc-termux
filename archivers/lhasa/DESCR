Lhasa is a library for parsing LHA (.lzh) archives and a free
replacement for the Unix LHA tool.

Currently it is only possible to read from (i.e., decompress)
archives; generating (compressing) LHA archives may be an enhancement
for future versions. The aim is to be compatible with as many
different variants of the LHA file format as possible, including
LArc (.lzs) and PMarc (.pma).

The command line tool aims to be interface-compatible with the
non-free Unix LHA tool (command line syntax and output), for
backwards compatibility with tools that expect particular output.
