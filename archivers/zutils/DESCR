Zutils is a collection of utilities able to deal with any combination
of compressed and non-compressed files transparently. If any given
file, including standard input, is compressed, its decompressed
content is used. Compressed files are decompressed on the fly; no
temporary files are created. These utilities are not wrapper scripts
but safer and more efficient C++ programs. In particular the
"--recursive" option is very efficient in those utilities supporting it.

The provided utilities are:
Zcat - Decompresses and copies files to standard output.
Zcmp - Decompresses and compares two files byte by byte.
Zdiff - Decompresses and compares two files line by line.
Zgrep - Decompresses and searches files for a regular expression.
Ztest - Tests integrity of compressed files.
