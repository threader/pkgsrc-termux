py-lz4 provides Python bindings for the LZ4 compression library by Yann
Collet.

At this time the project contains bindings for the LZ4 block format,
which are considered stable.

Support for the LZ4 frame format is a work-in-progress and available as a
technology preview. A future relase will implement support for the LZ4
stream format.
