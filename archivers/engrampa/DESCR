Engrampa is a fork of File-Roller.

Engrampa is an archive manager for the MATE environment.  This means
that you can create and modify archives; view the content of an archive;
view and modify a file contained in the archive; extract files from the
archive.

Engrampa is only a front-end (a graphical interface) to archiving programs
like tar and zip.
