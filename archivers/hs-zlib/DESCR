This package provides a pure interface for compressing and decompressing
streams of data represented as lazy ByteStrings. It uses the zlib C library
so it has high performance. It supports the "zlib", "gzip" and "raw"
compression formats.

It provides a convenient high level API suitable for most tasks and for the
few cases where more control is needed it provides access to the full zlib
feature set.
