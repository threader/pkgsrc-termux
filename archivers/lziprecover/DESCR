Lziprecover is a data recovery tool and decompressor for files in the
lzip compressed data format (.lz) able to repair slightly damaged files,
recover badly damaged files from two or more copies, extract undamaged
members from multi-member files, decompress files and test integrity of
files.

Lziprecover is able to recover or decompress files produced by any of
the compressors in the lzip family; lzip, plzip, minilzip/lzlib, clzip
and pdlzip. This recovery capability contributes to make the lzip format
one of the best options for long-term data archiving.

Lziprecover is able to efficiently extract a range of bytes from a
multi-member file, because it only decompresses the members containing
the desired data.
