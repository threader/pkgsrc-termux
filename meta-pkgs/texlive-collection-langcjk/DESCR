Packages supporting a combination of Chinese, Japanese, Korean,
including macros, fonts, documentation.  Also Thai in the c90
encoding, since there is some overlap in those fonts; standard
Thai support is in collection-langother.  Additional packages
for CJK are in their individual language collections.
