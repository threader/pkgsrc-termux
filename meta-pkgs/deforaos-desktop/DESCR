DeforaOS is an experimental Operating System project.

The DeforaOS Project intends to provide an innovative foundation to the
base system, while maintaining a compatibility layer with modern UNIX
systems. Most of its components are therefore meant to be portable and
functional on these systems as well.

This is a meta-package for the DeforaOS Desktop environment.
