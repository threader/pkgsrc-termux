In order to get the DeforaOS Desktop environment running properly, it is
recommended to start the following executables automatically within the X
session, and set to run in the background:

- desktop (desktop manager)
- locker (screensaver)
- panel
- phone (optional, for telephony support)

A sample session startup script can be found in:
${BINDIR}/deforaos-session.
