Simple dynamic window manager for X with features nicked from ratpoison and dwm:

 * Musca operates as a tiling window manager by default. It uses manual tiling,
   which means the user determines how the screen is divided into
   non-overlapping frames, with no restrictions on layout. Application windows
   always fill their assigned frame, with the exception of transient windows and
   popup dialog boxes which float above their parent application at the
   appropriate size. Once visible, applications do not change frames unless so
   instructed.
 * Since not all applications suit tiling, a more traditional stacking window
   manager mode is also available, allowing windows to float at any screen
   location and overlap.
 * There are no built in status bars, panels, tabs or window decorations to take
   up screen real estate. If the user wants any of these things, there are
   plenty of external applications available to do the job. Window decoration is
   limited to a slender border, which is coloured to indicate keyboard focus.
 * Windows are placed in named groups which can be used in a similar fashion to
   virtual desktops. Groups can be added and removed on the fly, and each group
   has its own frame layout.
 * The excellent dmenu utility is used to execute commands and launch
   applications, and it can also act as a window and group switcher. Basic EWMH
   support allows use of common panels, pagers and wmctrl.
 * Windows and frames are navigated and focused on any mouse button click,
   including rolling the wheel, or alternatively driven entirely by the
   keyboard. Simple key combinations exist for window switching, group
   switching, frame control and screen switching.
