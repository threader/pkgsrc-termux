echinus is a dynamic window manager for X11 supporting managing
windows in floating, tiled and maximized layouts based on dwm. All
the configuration is made via a config file in Xresources format,
so it is not necessary to recompile echinus every time you change
something.

echinus supports a small subset of EWMH to be compatible with
external panels and pagers. It draws a border around windows and
also an optional title bar. The goal of development is a small,
fast window manager without features not strictly related to window
management (menus, panels, etc.).
