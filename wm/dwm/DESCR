dwm is a dynamic window manager for X. It manages windows in tiled,
monocle and floating layouts. All of the layouts can be applied
dynamically, optimising the environment for the application in use
and the task performed.

In tiled layout windows are managed in a master and stacking area.
The master area contains the window which currently needs most
attention, whereas the stacking area contains all other windows.
In monocle layout all windows are maximised to the screen size. In
floating layout windows can be resized and moved freely.

Windows are grouped by tags. Each window can be tagged with one or
multiple tags. Selecting certain tags displays all windows with
these tags.

Each screen contains a small status bar which displays all available
tags, the layout, the number of visible windows, the title of the
focused window, and the text read from the root window name property,
if the screen is focused.
