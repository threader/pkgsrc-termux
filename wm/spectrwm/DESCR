Spectrwm is a small dynamic tiling window manager for X11. It tries
to stay out of the way so that valuable screen real estate can be
used for much more important stuff. It has sane defaults and does
not require one to learn a language to do any configuration. It
was written by hackers for hackers and it strives to be small,
compact and fast.

It was largely inspired by xmonad and dwm. Both are fine products
but suffer from things like: crazy-unportable-language-syndrome,
silly defaults, asymmetrical window layout, "how hard can it be?"
and good old NIH. Nevertheless dwm was a phenomenal resource and
many good ideas and code was borrowed from it. On the other hand
xmonad has great defaults, key bindings and xinerama support but
is crippled by not being written in C.

Spectrwm is a beautiful pearl! For it too, was created by grinding
irritation. Nothing is a bigger waste of time than moving windows
around until they are the right size-ish or having just about any
relevant key combination being eaten for some task one never needs.
The path of agony is too long to quote and in classical OpenBSD
fashion (put up, or hack up) a brand new window manager was whooped
up to serve no other purpose than to obey its masters. It was
written by Marco Peereboom & Ryan Thomas McBride and it is released
under the ISC license.
