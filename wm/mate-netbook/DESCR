A simple window management tool which:
  * Allows you to set basic rules for a window type, such as maximise|undecorate
  * Allows exceptions to the rules, based on string matching for window name
    and window class.
  * Allows 'reversing' of rules when the user manually changes something:
    * Re-decorates windows on un-maximise.
