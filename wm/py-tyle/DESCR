PyTyle is a manual tiling manager that can slide into any EWMH
compliant window manager, inspired by XMonad. It will allow you to
enable/disable tiling on a per screen per workspace basis, and
continually tile your windows.

Features include:
* Built in multi-monitor support (using Xinerama)
* Continuous tiling behavior similar to that of XMonad.
* Manual tiling on a per screen per workspace basis. Have tiling
  on one screen/workspace and not the other.
* Comes pre-packaged with a variety of tiling layouts ready for
  use. Also, PyTyle's object oriented design makes it incredibly easy
  to add or customize your own tiling layouts.
* Some configuration options include:
  * Adding margins on a per-screen basis (to force PyTyle to ignore
    docks/panels).
  * Tell PyTyle to ignore certain windows from tiling.
  * Configure defaults layouts on a per screen per workspace basis.
  * Completely customize all of PyTyle's key bindings.
* Dynamically reload configuration file.
