wmutils' opt

opt is at set of optional utilities meant to accompany wmutils-core.

Just as the wmutils-core programs, each utility does one job and does it well,
like dealing with window events or names.

opt has less utilities than core, here is a little overview:
 * chwb2 - control two different window borders
 * wew   - print window events
 * wname - print a window's name
 * xmmv  - move a window with the mouse
