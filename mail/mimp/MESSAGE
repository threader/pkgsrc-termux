Please refer to the file:

	${PREFIX}/share/doc/mimp/INSTALL

on how to setup your MIMP installation. You need to at least edit

	${PREFIX}/share/horde/config/registry.php

to enable MIMP in the horde framework.  You will also need to configure MIMP
by using the Horde administrative interface.

Finally you will also need to make MIMP accessible through your HTTP server.  If
you are running Apache and ap-php, then you can add the following lines
to httpd.conf:

	Include ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/mimp.conf
