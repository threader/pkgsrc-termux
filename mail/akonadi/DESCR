Akonadi is a new personal information management (PIM) framework for KDE 4 and
is set to be included in the 4.1 release. Akonadi will function as an extensible
data storage for all PIM applications. In KDE 3 all PIM applications had
different data storage and handling methods, which lead to several
implementations of essentially the same thing.  Besides data storage, Akonadi
has several other components including search, and a library (cache) for easy
access and notification of data changes.
