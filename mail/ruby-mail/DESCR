Mail is an internet library for Ruby that is designed to handle emails
generation, parsing and sending in a simple, rubyesque manner.

The purpose of this library is to provide a single point of access to handle
all email functions, including sending and receiving emails.  All network
type actions are done through proxy methods to Net::SMTP, Net::POP3 etc.

Built from my experience with TMail, it is designed to be a pure ruby
implementation that makes generating, sending and parsing emails a no
brainer.

It is also designed form the ground up to work with Ruby 1.9.  This is because
Ruby 1.9 handles text encodings much more magically than Ruby 1.8.x and so
these features have been taken full advantage of in this library allowing
Mail to handle a lot more messages more cleanly than TMail.  Mail does run on
Ruby 1.8.x... it's just not as fun to code.

Finally, Mail has been designed with a very simple object oriented system
that really opens up the email messages you are parsing, if you know what
you are doing, you can fiddle with every last bit of your email directly.
