Before you can use Majordomo, you will need to complete a few steps
manually:

	- configure ${MAJORDOMO_CF}.
	  be sure to change instances of ${HOSTNAME} as appropriate.

	- create lists in ${HOME}
	  Look in ${PREFIX}/share/doc/majordomo for information and see
	  the files and directories for an example list (example-l) in
	  ${PREFIX}/share/examples/majordomo.  Pay attention to the
	  permissions on the files and directories.

	- add a .forward file in ${HOME} (or an
	  appropriate alias) so administrative mail to
	  ${MAJORDOMO_USER} gets redirected properly.

	- install majordomo aliases for your mail server software.
	  For example, create ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/aliases following the
	  example in ${PREFIX}/share/examples/majordomo and add it to
	  your mailer configuration.

	  For sendmail, add a line similar to the following to
	  /etc/sendmail.cf :

	  OA${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/aliases (for 8.6.x Sendmail),

	  O AliasFile=/etc/mail/aliases,${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/aliases
	        (for 8.7.x and up),

	  or a line similar to the following to your m4 macros file:

	  define(`ALIAS_FILE',`/etc/mail/aliases,${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/aliases')

	  For postfix, add eg hash:${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/aliases
	  to the alias_maps and alias_database parameters in main.cf

	- for sendmail, if the group for ${MAJORDOMO_USER} (${MAJORDOMO_GROUP}) is not
	  daemon, add ${MAJORDOMO_USER} as a trusted user for your mailer.
	  This can be done by adding a line similar to the following
	  in /etc/sendmail.cf:

	  T${MAJORDOMO_USER}

	  or a line similar to the following to your m4 macros file:

	  define(`confTRUSTED_USERS', ${MAJORDOMO_USER})dnl

	- be sure to run `newaliases' to create the aliases database,
	  and be sure that your mailer has reloaded its config

	- add entries in /etc/newsyslog.conf to rotate the log in
	  ${HOME}/Log if necessary.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++ UPDATERS NOTICE +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

for resend, archive, bounce-remind, digest, request-answer and medit, the
environment setting for majordomo.cf now overrides the value given on the
command line with -C; config-test now only checks the compiled-in config file
location.
This is a cheap (and ugly) fix for a vulnerability. Since that environment
variable is compiled into the wrapper program, the listed perl programs
will be locked to ${MAJORDOMO_CF} when started via the wrapper.

Enjoy Majordomo!
