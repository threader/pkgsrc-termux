Use of Public DCC Servers
-------------------------

This package will by default query public servers; before running it
read the documentation and terms of use at:

  http://www.rhyolite.com/dcc/#public-servers

The essence is:

  Public DCC servers for anonymous DCC clients handling fewer than
  100,000 mail messages per day are provided by people and organizations
  in the following list. The default contents of /var/dcc/map file point
  to these servers.

  Note well that it has been wrong to take and resell the bandwidth and,
  most important, human system administration work of the public DCC
  servers to third parties. Blunt words for that include theft and
  stealing. Vendors of "spam appliances" or services including DCC such
  as "managed email" must provide DCC servers of their own or contract
  for DCC services from others. They must also buy a license for the
  commercial version of the DCC software.

(Note that these terms are similar but not identical to the license
for the dcc software itself.)

DCC Server (dccd)
-----------------

Running an own DCC server is strongly recommended if your site handles
more than 100k messages per day. It will decrease the load on public DCC
servers and increase the responsiveness of your DCC clients. When doing
so, cron-dccd should run at least once per day in order to remove old
checksums from the database:

   ${PREFIX}/libexec/cron-dccd
