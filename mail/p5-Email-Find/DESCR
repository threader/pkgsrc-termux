Email::Find is a module for finding a subset of RFC 822 email addresses in
arbitrary text (see "CAVEATS"). The addresses it finds are not guaranteed to
exist or even actually be email addresses at all (see "CAVEATS"), but they
will be valid RFC 822 syntax.

Email::Find will perform some heuristics to avoid some of the more obvious
red herrings and false addresses, but there's only so much which can be
done without a human.
