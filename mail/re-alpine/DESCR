Re-alpine is a fork of Alpine with a new development team.  (Alpine
is the official replacement for the Pine email and news client.)

Re-alpine is a screen-oriented message-handling tool (i.e. a mail
client) with many configurations for the novice and power user.

This package currently only installs the alpine binary, excluding
the pilot and pico binaries which would cause it to conflict with
the pine package.
