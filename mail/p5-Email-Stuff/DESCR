Email::Stuff, as its name suggests, is a fairly casual module used
to email "stuff" to people using the most common methods. It is a
high-level module designed for ease of use when doing a very specific
common task, but implemented on top of the tight and correct Email::
modules.

Email::Stuff is typically used to build emails and send them in a
single statement, as seen in the synopsis. And it is certain only
for use when creating and sending emails. As such, it contains no
email parsing capability, and little to no modification support.

To re-iterate, this is very much a module for those "slap it together
and fire it off" situations, but that still has enough grunt behind
the scenes to do things properly.
