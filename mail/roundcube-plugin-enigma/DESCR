Enigma Plugin for Roundcube

This plugin adds support for viewing and sending of signed and encrypted
messages in PGP (RFC 2440) and PGP/MIME (RFC 3156) format.

The plugin uses gpg binary on the server and stores all keys
(including private keys of the users) on the server.
Encryption/decryption is done server-side. So, this plugin
is for users that trust the server.

---------------------
+ PGP: signatures verification

+ PGP: keys management UI (key import, export, delete)
