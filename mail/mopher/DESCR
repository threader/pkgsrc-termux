The mail gopher (mopher) is an extension to all mail transfer agents
that implement the Sendmail Milter API.  It reads a list of rules and
acts on each incoming mail delivery attempt based on various criteria
and existing states.

Mopher supports indiscriminate and selective grey- and whitelisting of
either individual addresses or whole domains (based on reverse lookups
and rules provided by Mozilla's Public Suffix List).  Access to tables
and state-related data passes through a generic interface and is then
translated by one of the available backend drivers.
