This module implements RFC 2822 parser and formatter of email
addresses and groups. It parses an input string from email headers
which contain a list of email addresses or a groups of email addresses
(like From, To, Cc, Bcc, Reply-To, Sender, ...). Also it can generate
a string value for those headers from a list of email addresses
objects.

Parser and formatter functionality is implemented in XS and uses
shared code from Dovecot IMAP server.
