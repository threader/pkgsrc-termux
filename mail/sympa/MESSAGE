Run ${SYMPA_BIN}/sympa_wizard.pl
for interactive configuration.

If you are upgrading from a previous version please consult
${PREFIX}/share/doc/sympa/NEWS
for incompatible changes, and run:
${SYMPA_BIN}/sympa.pl --upgrade

Note that configuration files sympa.conf and wwsympa.conf are merged
to sympa.conf now. ${SYMPA_BIN}/sympa.pl --upgrade will take care of that.

You also need to ajust paths in your httpd.conf file:
/static-sympa is now ${PREFIX}/sympa/static_content
and you need to add:
/static-sympa/icons  ${SYMPA_VARBASE}/list_data/static_content/icons
/static-sympa/css  ${SYMPA_VARBASE}/list_data/static_content/css
