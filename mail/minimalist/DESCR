Minimalist stands for Minimalistic Mailing Lists Manager. Although it is
declared as minimalistic, it has many features as his eldest brosers, such
as Majordomo and so on, but in contrast to them it is very small, fast,
simple for setup and maintenance. Also it has very clean internal structure
and if you are familiar with Perl, you can add as many additional features,
as you need.
