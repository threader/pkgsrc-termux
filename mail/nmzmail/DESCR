nmzmail is a tool to use the namazu search engine from within the mutt mail
client to search mail stored in maildir folders. Based on the result of the
namazu query, nmzmail generates a maildir folder containing symbolic links to
the mails matching the query. A simple mutt macro makes easy to use nmzmail from
within mutt. nmzmail is pretty similar to mairix, but the code is much simpler,
as it uses an external program as search engine.
