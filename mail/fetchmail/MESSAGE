If the upgrade you did encompassed an upgrade to OpenSSL 1.0.0 or newer,
you may need to run c_rehash on your certificate directories, particularly
if you are using local certs directories (f. i. through fetchmail's
--sslcertpath option).

Reason: OpenSSL 1.0.0, relative to earlier versions, uses a different hash
for the symbolic links (symlinks) in its certs/ directory, so you need to
recreate the symlinks by running c_rehash /etc/ssl/certs (adjust this to
where your installation keeps its certificates), and you cannot easily
share this certs directory with applications linked against older OpenSSL
versions.
