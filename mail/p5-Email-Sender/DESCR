Email::Sender replaces the old and sometimes problematic Email::Send
library, which did a decent job at handling very simple email
sending tasks, but was not suitable for serious use, for a variety
of reasons.

At present, the casual user is probably best off using
Email::Send::Transport::Sendmail. If a local sendmail program is
unavailable, Email::Send::Transport::SMTP will allow you to send
mail through your relay host.

In the future, Email::Sender::Simple will provide a very simple
interface for sending mail.
