File::KeePass gives access to KeePass version 1 (kdb) and version
2 (kdbx) databases.

The version 1 and version 2 databases are very different in
construction, but the majority of information overlaps and many
algorithms are similar. File::KeePass attempts to iron out as many
of the differences.

File::KeePass gives nearly raw data access. There are a few utility
methods for manipulating groups and entries. More advanced manipulation
can easily be layered on top by other modules.

File::KeePass is only used for reading and writing databases and
for keeping passwords scrambled while in memory. Programs dealing
with UI or using of auto-type features are the domain of other
modules on CPAN. File::KeePass::Agent is one example.
