A simple password-based encryption utility is available as a demonstration
of the scrypt key derivation function. On modern hardware and with default
parameters, the cost of cracking the password on a file encrypted by scrypt
enc is approximately 100 billion times more than the cost of cracking the
same password on a file encrypted by openssl enc; this means that a five-
character password using scrypt is stronger than a ten-character password
using openssl
