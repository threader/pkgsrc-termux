Read `pam_fprint_enroll --help' to learn about enrolling fingers. The
fingerprint data is stored in the users home directory under the .fprint
directory, and the program must have read/write access to the USB devices.

After enrolling fingerprints for your user(s), you can enable finger
print authentication by adding the following line to the corresponding
PAM configuration file(s) in /etc/pam.d

auth            sufficient      ${PREFIX}/lib/security/pam_fprint.so

Note that using a fingerprint to authenticate is not particularly
secure, see the pam_fprint web site for more information.
