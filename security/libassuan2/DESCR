The Libassuan package contains an IPC library used by some of the
other GnuPG related packages. Libassuan's primary use is to allow
a client to interact with a non-persistent server. Libassuan is
not, however, limited to use with GnuPG servers and clients. It
was designed to be flexible enough to meet the demands of many
transaction based environments with non-persistent servers.
