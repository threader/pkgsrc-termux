HElib is a software library that implements homomorphic encryption
(HE).  Currently available is an implementation of the
Brakerski-Gentry-Vaikuntanathan (BGV) scheme, along with many
optimizations to make homomorphic evaluation run faster, focusing
mostly on effective use of the Smart-Vercauteren ciphertext packing
techniques and the Gentry-Halevi-Smart optimizations.
