In simple terms, this package provides a library for implementing the
sharing of secrets and two tools for simple use-cases of the
algorithm.  The library implements what is known as Shamir's method
for secret sharing in the Galois Field 2^8.  In slightly simpler words,
this is N-of-M secret-sharing byte-by-byte.  Essentially this allows
us to split a secret S into any M shares S1..SM such that any N of
those shares can be used to reconstruct S but any less than N shares
yields no information whatsoever.
