${PKGNAME} by default does *not* install any authentication plugin
modules.  Until the necessary authentication plugin modules are
installed, e.g. security/cy2-crammd5 or security/cy2-gssapi, you
will probably get errors about "no appropriate mechs available".

The configuration files for applications using the sasl2 libraries
used to be in ${PLUGINDIR}/, but are now expected in
${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/. You need to move them after upgrading the pkg.

${PKGNAME} will use the following directory as the default
path to its plugin modules:

	${PLUGINDIR}

The search path for plugin modules can be customized by setting the
SASL_PATH variable to a colon-delimted list of directories in the shell
environment.

To allow plaintext authentication without using the auxprop mechanism, the
package security/cyrus-saslauthd should be installed.
