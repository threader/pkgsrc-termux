This is a hack for managing the certificate files installed into
the OpenSSL certs directory by the mozilla-rootcerts package.

For native OpenSSL it operates directly in /etc/ssl/certs (because it
has to) and not under the pkgsrc prefix, and even for pkgsrc OpenSSL
it still scribbles in $PREFIX/etc/ssl/certs where packages normally
shouldn't. Be advised.
