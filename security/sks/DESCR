SKS is a new OpenPGP keyserver whose goal is to provide easy to deploy,
decentralized, and highly reliable synchronization.  That means that a key
submitted to one SKS server will quickly be distributed to all key servers,
and even wildly out-of-date servers, or servers that experience spotty
connectivity, can fully synchronize with rest of the system.
