Digest::SHA3 is a complete implementation of the NIST SHA-3
cryptographic hash function, known originally as Keccak. It
gives Perl programmers a convenient way to calculate SHA3-224,
SHA3-256, SHA3-384, and SHA3-512 message digests, as well as
variable-length hashes using the SHA3-0 variant. The module
can handle all types of input, including partial-byte data.
