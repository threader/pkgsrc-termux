Kerberos V5 is an authentication system developed at MIT. It is a network
authentication protocol designed to provide strong authentication for
client/server applications by using secret-key cryptography. (Kerberos
5 is discussed in RFC 1510.)

This package provides Kerberos applications and servers for telnet,
the r-services and ftp.
