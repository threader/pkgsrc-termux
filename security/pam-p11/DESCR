Pam_p11 is a plugable authentication module (PAM) package for using
crpytographic PKCS#11 tokens such as smart cards and usb crypto
tokens for local authentication.

Pam_p11 implements two authentication modules:
* pam_p11_openssh authenticates the user against public keys found
in OpenSSH ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file.
* pam_p11_opensc authenticates the user against certificates found
in ~/.eid/authorized_certificates.

This project is no longer maintained upstream.
