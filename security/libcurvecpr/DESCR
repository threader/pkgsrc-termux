libcurvecpr is a low-level, networking-independent implementation of
Daniel J.  Bernstein's CurveCP.

libcurvecpr is based on a system of callbacks that must be implemented
by library users.  Like the reference CurveCP implementation, the
client, server, and message-handling portions of libcurvecpr are
entirely independent of each other.

This means that while it's slightly more effort to build software
based on libcurvecpr than other packages, it provides complete freedom
to use any underlying mechanism for handling network traffic you want
- whether it's an IPC connection to another program, standard
poll(2)-type functionality, or libev.
