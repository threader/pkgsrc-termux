OAuth often seems complicated and difficult-to-implement. There are several
prominent libraries for handling OAuth requests, but they all suffer from one
or both of the following:

  *  They predate the OAuth 1.0 spec, AKA RFC 5849.
  *  They predate the OAuth 2.0 spec, AKA RFC 6749.
  *  They assume the usage of a specific HTTP request library.

OAuthLib is a generic utility which implements the logic of OAuth without
assuming a specific HTTP request object or web framework. Use it to graft OAuth
client support onto your favorite HTTP library, or provider support onto your
favourite web framework. If you're a maintainer of such a library, write a thin
veneer on top of OAuthLib and get OAuth support for very little effort.
