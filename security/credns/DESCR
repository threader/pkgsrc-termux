Credns is a software program aimed at fortifying DNSSEC by performing
validation in the DNS notify/transfer-chain. Currently credns is a fork
of the NSD_3_2 branch that has been extended with the possibility to
assess zones (received or updated by AXFR or IXFR) by running an external
verifier. Only zones that are deemed correct by the verifier will be
notified to (public) slave servers and offered for transfer.
