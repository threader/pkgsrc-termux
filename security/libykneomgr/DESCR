This is a C library to interact with the CCID-part of the YubiKey
NEO. There is a command line tool "ykneomgr" for interactive use.
It supports querying the YubiKey NEO for firmware version, operation
mode (OTP/CCID) and serial number. You may also mode switch the
device and manage applets (list, delete and install).
