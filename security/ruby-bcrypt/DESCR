== Why you should use bcrypt

If you store user passwords in the clear, then an attacker who steals a copy of
your database has a giant list of emails and passwords. Some of your users will
only have one password - for their email account, for their banking account, for
your application. A simple hack could escalate into massive identity theft.

It's your responsibility as a web developer to make your web application secure
- blaming your users for not being security experts is not a professional
response to risk.

bcrypt allows you to easily harden your application against these
kinds of attacks.
