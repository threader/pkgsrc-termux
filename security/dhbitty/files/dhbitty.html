<p><span class="dhb"><b>dhbitty</b></span> is a small public key encryption 
program written in C. It uses elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman in the form of 
Curve25519 to establish a shared secret between two users, and uses that secret 
to symmetrically encrypt and authenticate messages.</p>

<p><span class="dhb">dhbitty</span> differs from most other public key 
encryption programs in a few significant ways.</p>

<ul>
<li>There are no private key files; only passphrases. Never lose that pesky 
thing again.</li>
<li>Both the sender and the receiver can decrypt a message. In fact, there is 
no distinction between sender and receiver. Both passphrases must be strong.</li>
<li>There is no signing. A similarly useful form of authentication occurs using 
only DH.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="dhb">dhbitty</span> attempts to be as simple as possible. It is 
not optimized, but achieves a comfortable speed for most uses. It does not use 
floating point numbers, or integers longer than 32 bits. It does not contain 
more algorithms than are needed.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>This is how Alice generates her public key with dhbitty:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="alice">dhbitty generate alice_public_key.txt</span>
username:passphrase (this is visible!): <span class="alice">alice:Keyfiles be damned!</span>
Done.</pre>

<p>Bob will do the same thing:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="bob">dhbitty generate bob_public_key.txt</span>
username:passphrase (this is visible!): <span class="bob">bob:Bob's Spectacular Passphrase</span>
Done.</pre>

<p>Alice will publish her <span class="fn">alice_public_key.txt</span>, and Bob 
will publish his <span class="fn">bob_public_key.txt</span>. They can now 
access each other's public keys. (But they should be careful that Eve cannot 
surreptitiously replace either public key with her own!)</p>

<p>Alice wants to send files to Bob. She packages them into a 
<span class="fn">.tar</span> archive (or any other type of archive with 
timestamps), along with her message. Then she uses dhbitty:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="alice">dhbitty encrypt bob_public_key.txt files_to_bob.tar files_to_bob.tar.dhbt</span>
username:passphrase (this is visible!): <span class="alice">alice:Keyfiles be damned!</span>
Done.</pre>

<p>Alice sends <span class="fn">files_to_bob.tar.dhbt</span> to Bob. Bob will 
use dhbitty to decrypt this archive:</p>

<pre>$ <span class="bob">dhbitty decrypt files_to_bob.tar.dhbt files_to_bob.tar</span>
username:passphrase (this is visible!): <span class="bob">bob:Bob's Spectacular Passphrase</span>
This is the public key of file's secondary owner:
0002f02b318c307bac07f3148a33c975cea04b79a870f0a5c7771cd38cc1986e
Done.</pre>

<p>Bob can verify that the public key dhbitty just gave him indeed is Alice's 
public key. He unpacks the now-decrypted archive to access the files Alice sent 
to him.</p>

<p>In practice, Alice and Bob should use a system like diceware to pick 
passphrases, in order to be confident of their strength. Seven words picked 
using diceware is a good choice.</p>

<h2>Technical summary</h2>

<p>The key derivation function works like this: T(H(H(input) || S(H(input)))).  
Here H is a 512-bit hash function built by using the EnRUPT block cipher in the 
sponge construction. S is an expensive function that compresses 512 bits to 32 
bits. Finally, T truncates 512 bits to 256 bits. The AT cost of this 
construction is similar to 2<sup>32</sup> iterations of SHA-1; I'll reserve the 
details for another document. The return value works directly as a Curve25519 
private key (after fixing several bits, which is handled within the DH 
function).</p>

<p>When a file is encrypted, both public keys will be included in the output 
file, in sorted order.</p>

<p>For symmetric encryption and authentication, an EnRUPT sponge context is 
initialized for each using the shared secret, a random 128-bit nonce, and a 
public string ("encrypt" or "authenticate"). The data is encrypted and then 
authenticated in a single pass.</p>

<p>If on Windows, CryptGenRandom is used for randomness. Otherwise, reading 
from /dev/urandom is attempted.</p>

<p>This is the file format:</p>
<ul>
<li>32 bytes: public key 1</li>
<li>32 bytes: public key 2</li>
<li>16 bytes: nonce</li>
<li>?? bytes: ciphertext</li>
<li>16 bytes: tag</li>
</ul>
