This module implements a wrapper around OpenSSL. Specifically, it wraps the
methods related to the US Government's Advanced Encryption Standard (the
Rijndael algorithm).
This module is compatible with Crypt::CBC (and likely other modules that
utilize a block cipher to make a stream cipher).
This module is an alternative to the implementation provided by Crypt::Rijndael
which implements AES itself. In contrast, this module is simply a wrapper
around the OpenSSL library.
The Crypt::Rijndael implementation seems to produce inaccurate results on
64-bit x86 machines. By using OpenSSL, this module aims to avoid architecture
specific problems, allowing the OpenSSL maintainers to overcome such issues.
