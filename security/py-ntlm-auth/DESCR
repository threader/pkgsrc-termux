This library handles the low-level details of NTLM authentication for use
in authenticating with a service that uses NTLM. It will create and parse
the 3 different message types in the order required and produce a base64
encoded value that can be attached to the HTTP header.

Features:
- LM, NTLM and NTLMv2 authentication
- NTLM1 and NTLM2 extended session security
- Set the The NTLM Compatibility level when sending messages
- Channel Binding Tokens support, need to pass in the SHA256 hash of the
  certificate for it to work
- Support for MIC to enhance the integrity of the messages
- Support for session security with signing and sealing messages after
  authentication happens
