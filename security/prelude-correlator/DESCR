Prelude-Correlator serves to correlate, in real time, the multiple
events received by Prelude. Several isolated alerts, generated
from different sensors, can thus trigger a single correlation
alert should the events be related. This correlation alert then
appears within the Prewikka interface and indicates the potential
target information via the set of correlation rules.

Signature creation with Prelude-Correlator is based on the powerful
programming language Lua.
