The Digest::JHash module allows you to use the fast JHash hashing
algorithm developed by Bob Jenkins from within Perl programs. The
algorithm takes as input a message of arbitrary length and produces
as output a 32-bit "message digest" of the input in the form of an
unsigned long integer.

Call it a low calorie version of MD5 if you like.
