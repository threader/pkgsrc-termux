YubiAuth provides a user management system which can be used as a
base for other systems. It allows the creation of users, which can
be authenticated by username, password, and optionally a YubiKey
OTP.
Aside from providing a user authentication backend, YubiAuth allows
storing and retrieving arbitrary key-value attributes for each user
as well as each YubiKey.
