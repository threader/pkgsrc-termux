OAuth (Open Authorization) is an open standard that allows users to
share their private resources (e.g.  photos, videos, contact lists)
stored on one site with another site without having to hand out their
username and password.

OAuth allows users to hand out tokens instead of usernames and
passwords to their data hosted by a given service provider.  Each
token grants access to a specific site (e.g.  a video editing site)
for specific resources (e.g.  just videos from a specific album) and
for a defined duration (e.g.  the next 2 hours).

Thus OAuth allows a user to grant a third party site access to their
information stored with another service provider, without sharing
their access permissions or the full extent of their data.

OAuth is a service that is complementary to but distinct from OpenID.
