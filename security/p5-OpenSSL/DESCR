THIS IS AN UGLY HACK (nichts fÃ¼r die Goldwaage..)

Don't read the man-pages/*.pm's (they are dummy), check t/*
and fix OpenSSL.xs

Don't forget to try -
print OpenSSL::CRL::new_from_file("crl.pem")->info
- it's the only CRL stuff that's supported :)

OpenSSL::HMAC is dummy.
OpenSSL::BN is untested.
