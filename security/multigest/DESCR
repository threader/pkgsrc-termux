The multigest utility calculates message digests of files or, if no
file is specified, standard input.  The list of possible algorithms is
given in the libmultigest(3) manual page.

The multigest utility is a simple wrapper for the various different
algorithm implementations, and was designed to be scalable as new
message digest algorithms are developed.
