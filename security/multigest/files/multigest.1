.Sh NAME
.Nm multigest
.Nd calculate multiple message digests simultaneously
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Fl r
.Op Fl a Ar algorithms
.Op Fl c Ar digestfile
.Op Fl F Ar output-format
.Op Fl o Ar output
.Op Fl S Ar output-separator
.Op Fl s Ar /regex/replacement/
.Op file ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility calculates message digests of files or,
if no file is specified, standard input.
The list of possible algorithms is given in the
.Xr libmultigest 3
manual page.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility is a simple wrapper for the various different
algorithm implementations, which are located in the standard
C library, and was designed to be scalable as new message digest
algorithms are developed.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility uses the
.Xr libmultigest 3
library.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width XregexXreplacementXYYY
.It Fl a Ar algorithms
specify a comma-separated list of algorithms to be calculated
.It Fl c Ar stored-digest-file
check, or verify, a file containing previously-generated digests
.It Fl F Ar output-format
print the output in the format requested.
Possible values are
.Dq openssl ,
.Dq digest ,
and
.Dq multigest .
The default is
.Dq multigest
which means that any replacement text is printed in a separate field.
.It Fl o Ar output-file
write the calculated digests to the output file
.It Fl r
shorthand for input substitution for the RCS Identifiers
.Dq Id
and
.Dq NetBSD
.It Fl S Ar output-separator
separate each individual digest on output with the provided string.
The output separator defaults to the null string, i.e. no separator.
.It Fl s Ar /regex/replacement/
before calculating digests, run the following transformation on the input
to normalise any input.
Using this, the effects of expanding version control system
identifiers is nullified.
.El
.Pp
If no input files are provided, input is taken from standard input.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std multigest

The
.Nm
utility first appeared in
.Nx 7.0 .

.Nm
utility was written by
