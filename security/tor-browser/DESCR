What is the Tor Browser?

The Tor software protects you by bouncing your communications around
a distributed network of relays run by volunteers all around the
world: it prevents somebody watching your Internet connection from
learning what sites you visit, it prevents the sites you visit from
learning your physical location, and it lets you access sites which
are blocked.
