Mohawk is an alternate Python implementation of the Hawk HTTP authorization
scheme.

Hawk lets two parties securely communicate with each other using messages
signed by a shared key. It is based on HTTP MAC access authentication (which
was based on parts of OAuth 1.0).

The Mohawk API is a little different from that of the Node library (i.e. the
living Hawk spec). It was redesigned to be more intuitive to developers, less
prone to security problems, and more Pythonic.
