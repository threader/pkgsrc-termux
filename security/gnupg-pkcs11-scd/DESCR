gnupg-pkcs11 is a project to implement a BSD-licensed smart-card
daemon to enable the use of PKCS#11 tokens with GnuPG. The motivation
behind this project originates in the following two threads:

 * http://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnupg-users/2006-February/027964.html
 * http://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnupg-devel/2004-November/021522.html
 * http://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnupg-users/2004-November/023673.html

PKCS#11 is the de-facto standard for accessing cryptographic tokens,
and thus we strongly disagree with WK's attitude towards it.

The patch mentioned in the above threads is unmaintained, so we
decided to implement PKCS#11 support "the right way". gnupg-pkcs11
is a (hopefully) drop-in replacement for the smart-card daemon
(scd) shipped with GnuPG.
