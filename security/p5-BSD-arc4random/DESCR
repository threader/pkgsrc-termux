This module provides a Perl API for the BSDs' arc4random(3) suite
of functions and adds a few high-level functions, such as the new
arc4random_uniform(3). The Perl functions are ithreads-safe (only
if threads::shared is required). Scalars can be tied to this pak-
kage, yielding uniformly distributed random numbers with an arbi-
trary upper bound on read access, contributing to the RC4 entropy
pool on write access. An exported global $RANDOM variable returns
15-bit unsigned random numbers, from [0; 32767], similar to mksh.
Furthermore, Perl's internal PRNG is seeded with entropy obtained
from the arc4random generator once on module load time.
