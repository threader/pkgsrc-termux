sshfp is a small utility that generates RFC4255 SSHFP DNS records
based on the public keys stored in a known_hosts file or obtained by
using ssh-keyscan.  If the nameserver of the domain allows zone
tranfers (AXFR), an entire domain can be processed for all its A
records.  These can then be easily added to a zone, and then secured
by DNSSEC.
