libmultigest is a library interface to calculate multiple digests at
the same time, without having to re-scan data.  This is to protect
against any single digest algorithm being found to have second
pre-images.  Up to 32 digests can be specified on the command line.

The data being used as input to the digest can be modified by using a
regular expression-based substitution operation, so that any Version
Control System identifiers can be normalised before being digested.
If no substitution regular expression is provided, the input data will
be used as-is.

The list of digests provided is:

	BLAKE2, CRC32C, MD5, RMD160, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512,
	SHA3-224, SHA3-256, SHA3-384, SHA3-512, SIZE,
	TIGER, TIGER2, WHIRLPOOL
