A python library for parsing, manipulating, and generating CybOX content.

A primary goal of the python-cybox library is to remain faithful to both the
CybOX standard and to customary Python practices. There are places where these
will conflict, and the goal is to make the library intuitive both to those
familiar with the XML schemas (but less familiar with Python) and also to
experienced Python developers who want to add CybOX support to their programs.
