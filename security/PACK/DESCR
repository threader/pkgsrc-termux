PACK (Password Analysis and Cracking Toolkit) is a collection of
utilities developed to aid in analysis of password lists and
enhancing cracking of passwords using smart rule generation. It
can be used to reverse word mangling rules, generate source words
and optimize password masks for the Hashcat family of tools.

NOTE: The toolkit itself is not able to crack passwords, but instead
designed to make operation of password crackers more efficient.
