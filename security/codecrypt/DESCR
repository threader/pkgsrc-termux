This is a GnuPG-like unix program for encryption and signing that uses
only quantum-computer-resistant algorithms:

+ McEliece cryptosystem (compact QC-MDPC variant) for encryption
+ Hash-based Merkle tree algorithm (FMTSeq variant) for digital
signatures

Stream ciphers used:  ChaCha20, XSynd stream cipher, RC4 (for initial
simplicity of implementation)

CRHFs used:
+ Cubehash variants were selected for implementation ease, really
clean design, quite good speed and flexibility of parameter choices.
KeyID's are CUBE256 hashes of serialized public key.
+ ripemd128 for small hashes
+ tiger192 is used as an alternative for Cubehash for 192bit hashes
+ There's always a variant with SHA-256, SHA-384 or SHA-512.

Signature algorithms:
+ FMTSeq with many possibilities and combinations of aforementioned CRHFs

Encryption:
MDPC McEliece on quasi-cyclic matrices - decoding is (slightly)
 vulnerable to timing attacks.
