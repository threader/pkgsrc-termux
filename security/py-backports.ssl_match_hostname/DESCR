The Secure Sockets layer is only actually secure if you check the
hostname in the certificate returned by the server to which you
are connecting, and verify that it matches to hostname that you
are trying to reach.

But the matching logic, defined in RFC2818, can be a bit tricky to
implement on your own. So the ssl package in the Standard Library
of Python 3.2 and greater now includes a match_hostname() function
for performing this check instead of requiring every application
to implement the check separately.

This package contains the backport of this functionality to Python 2.
