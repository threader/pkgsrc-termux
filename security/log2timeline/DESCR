log2timeline is a framework built to automatically create a super
timeline using information found within various log files and other
files that contain timestamps.  The tool can be used to augment
traditional timeline analysis where the focus has generally been on
solely the timestamps found within the filesystem itself.
The tool is also capable of outputting into various formats that
can be used to either import into analysis tools or to read directly
using whatevery suits you (spreadsheet/vim/less/...)
