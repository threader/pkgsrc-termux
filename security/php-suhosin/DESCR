Suhosin is an advanced protection system for PHP installations. It was
designed to protect servers and users from known and unknown flaws in
PHP applications and the PHP core. Suhosin comes in two independent
parts, that can be used separately or in combination. The first part is
a small patch against the PHP core, that implements a few low-level
protections against bufferoverflows or format string vulnerabilities and
the second part is a powerful PHP extension that implements all the other
protections.

Unlike our Hardening-Patch Suhosin is binary compatible to normal PHP
installation, which means it is compatible to 3rd party binary extension
like ZendOptimizer.
