PAM provides a way to develop programs that are independent of
authentication scheme.  These programs need "authentication modules" to be
attached to them at run-time in order to work.  Which authentication module
is to be attached is dependent upon the local system setup and is at the
discretion of the local system administrator.

This package contains a PAM module that perform a crude
check on a SAML authentication assertion. The assertion signature and date
are verified, and access is granted on behalf ot the user taked for a
onfigurable attribute.

The only protection against replay attacks is the assertion validity dates
checks, this authentication is therefore secure only if the SAML
authentication assertion remains secret. The assertion has the same role
as a web cookie used for authentication.
