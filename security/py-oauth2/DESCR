This code was originally forked from Leah Culver and Andy Smith's
oauth.py code. Some of the tests come from a fork by Vic Fryzel, while
a revamped Request class and more tests were merged in from Mark
Paschal's fork. A number of notable differences exist between this
code and its forefathers:

  100% unit test coverage.
  The DataStore object has been completely ripped out. While
    creating unit tests for the library I found several substantial
    bugs with the implementation and confirmed with Andy Smith that it
    was never fully baked.
  Classes are no longer prefixed with OAuth.
  The Request class now extends from dict.
  The library is likely no longer compatible with Python 2.3.
  The Client class works and extends from httplib2. It's a thin
    wrapper that handles automatically signing any normal HTTP request
    you might wish to make.
