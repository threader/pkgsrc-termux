The PBC (Pairing-Based Cryptography) library is a free C library built
on the GMP library that performs the mathematical operations
underlying pairing-based cryptosystems.

It provides routines such as elliptic curve generation, elliptic curve
arithmetic and pairing computation.

The API is abstract enough that the PBC library can be used even if
the programmer possesses only an elementary understanding of pairings.
There is no need to learn about elliptic curves or much of number
theory.  (The minimum requirement is some knowledge of cyclic groups
and properties of the pairing.)
