k5start, and krenew are modified versions of kinit which add support
for running as a daemon to maintain a ticket cache, running a
command with credentials from a keytab and maintaining a ticket
cache until that command completes, obtaining AFS tokens (via an
external aklog) after obtaining tickets, and creating an AFS PAG
for a command. They are primarily useful in conjunction with
long-running jobs; for moving ticket handling code out of servers,
cron jobs, or daemons; and to obtain tickets and AFS tokens with
a single command.
