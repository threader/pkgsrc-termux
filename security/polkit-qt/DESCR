Polkit-qt aims to make it easy for Qt developers to take advantage of
PolicyKit API. It is a convenience wrapper around QAction and QAbstractButton
that lets you integrate those two components easily with PolicyKit.

Polkit-qt is splitted in two libraries: polkit-qt-core and polkit-qt-gui.

polkit-qt-core lets you control actions and authentication without a GUI,
with some very simple functions. It also lets you retrieve and control useful
informations on the PolicyKit context. It includes the classes Auth and
Context.

polkit-qt-gui lets you easily associate GUI items with PolicyKit actions.
By some simple wrapper classes you are able to associate QAction and
QAbstractButton to a PolicyKit action, and get their properties changed
accordingly to PolicyKit result. It includes the classes Action, ActionButton
and ActionButtons
