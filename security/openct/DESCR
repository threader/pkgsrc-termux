Drivers for several smart card readers. OpenCT comes as driver in ifdhandler
format for PC/SC-Lite, as CT-API driver, or as a small and lean middleware,
so applications can use it with minimal overhead. OpenCT also has a primitive
mechanism to export smart card readers to remote machines via TCP/IP.

This package is obsolete.  See pcsc-lite for an alternative.
