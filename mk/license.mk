# This file handles everything about the LICENSE variable. It is
# included automatically by bsd.pkg.mk.
#
# XXX There should be one place to set the default list and for users
# to set the ACCEPTABLE_LICENSES list, used by both source builds and
# binary installs#
#
# XXX: Some of this content arguably belongs in the pkgsrc guide
# instead.
#
# === User-settable variables ===
#
# ACCEPTABLE_LICENSES
#
#	If a package declares a license and that license is not a
#	member of the list defined by this variable, pkgsrc will not
#	build the package and instead print an error message.
#	(pkg_install has code to behave the same way, but it is not
#	yet turned on.)
#
#	XXX: Perhaps there should be some mechanism to prevent running
#	programs that are part of packages that declare LICENSEs that
#	are not in ACCEPTABLE_LICENSES or some per-user variable.
#	This is surely controversial and requires discussion.
#
#	To include the default licenses, you can use the += operator
#	in mk.conf. To override it, use the plain = operator.
#
#	Default value: ${DEFAULT_ACCEPTABLE_LICENSES}
#
# === Package-settable variables ===
#
# LICENSE
#
#	The license of the package.
#
#	Dual licenses can be specified with OR expressions:
#	LICENSE=	license1 OR license2
#
#	If more than one license applies at the same time, AND expressions
#	can be used:
#	LICENSE=	license1 AND license2
#
#	Expressions can be nested if necessary:
#	LICENSE=	(license1 AND license2) OR license3
#	Parenthesis are required when mixing AND and OR.
#
#	Every package should specify its license.  (Prior to early 2009,
#	Open Source and Free software did not have license tags.)
#
#	Licenses are collected in the licenses/ subdirectory of
#	pkgsrc.  For open source license, we generally use the same
#	names as either the Open Source Initiative or the Free
#	Software Foundation, choosing a name to reduce confusion.
#	Open source and free licenses do not have a -license suffix,
#	and non-free licenses do.

#
# === Predefined variables ===
#
# DEFAULT_ACCEPTABLE_LICENSES
#	The list of licenses that will be the default value of
#	ACCEPTABLE_LICENSES.  Adapting the longstanding policy of Open
#	Source or Free licenses not requiring tags, it should contain
#	almost all licenses that are Open Source or Free, so as to provide
#	the most expansive default that almost all people find
#	acceptable.  (Many people will want to add more licenses to
#	ACCEPTABLE_LICENSES; the point is to have a default that very
#	few people want to shrink.)
#
#	As an exception to the Open Source or Free policy, the board
#	of The NetBSD Foundation has decided that licenses that
#	trigger obligations from use (rather than redistribution),
#	such as the Affero GPL, should not be in
#	DEFAULT_ACCEPTABLE_LICENSES.
#
#	Licenses not formally approved as Free or Open Source may be
#	added if they have terms that would obviously be approved if
#	the effort were made.  Such license names will have a comment
#	near them in the assignment to DEFAULT_ACCEPTABLE_LICENSES.
#
#	The pkg_install sources also have a
#	DEFAULT_ACCEPTABLE_LICENSES list, and that should be updated
#	to match the list here.  See
#	pkgsrc/pkgtools/pkg_install/files/lib/license.c
#
# === See also ===
#
#	../doc/TODO, section "Licenses of packages"
#
# Keywords: licence license
#

# This list is not complete.  Free and Open Source licenses should be
# added to the list as they are added to pkgsrc.

# The convention is that Free or Open Source licenses do not have a
# -license suffix, and nonfree licenses end in -license.
