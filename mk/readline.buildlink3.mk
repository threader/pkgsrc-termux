# $NetBSD: readline.buildlink3.mk,v 1.5 2016/04/11 04:22:34 dbj Exp $
#
# This Makefile fragment is meant to be included by packages that require
# any readline implementation instead of one particular one.  The available
# readline/editline implementations are "editline" and "readline".
#
# If a package genuinely requires editline or readline, then it should
# directly include the appropriate buildlink3.mk instead of this file in
# the package Makefile.
#
# === User-settable variables ===
#
# READLINE_DEFAULT
#	This value represents the type of readline we wish to use on the
#	system.  Setting this to "editline" means that the system libedit
#	implementation is fine or pkgsrc "editline" should be used.
#
#	Possible: editline readline
#	Default: (depends)
#
# === Variables set by this file ===
#
# READLINE_TYPE
#	The name of the selected readline implementation, editline or
#	readline.
