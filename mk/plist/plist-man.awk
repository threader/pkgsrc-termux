### This awk script handles man page entries in PLISTs.  This script
### requires the following scripts to be included:
###
###     plist-functions.awk (print_entry)
###
### Certain environment variables must be set prior to running this script:
###
### CATMAN_SECTION_SUFFIX is a yes/no variable that determines whether to use
###	the catman page section as the suffix or .0 if not.
###
### IMAKE_MANINSTALL specifies how imake-using packages install man pages.
###	Valid values are:
###
###	    no value	the package doesn't use imake
###	    maninstall	the package installed man pages
###	    catinstall  the package installed catman pages
###
###	Both "maninstall" and "catinstall" may be specified.
###
### MANINSTALL specifies if man pages are installed by the package.
###	Valid values are:
###
###	    maninstall	the package installed man pages
###	    catinstall  the package installed catman pages
###
###	Both "maninstall" and "catinstall" may be specified.
###
### MANZ is a yes/no variable that determines whether the man pages
###     should be recorded as compressed or not.
###
### PKGMANDIR is the ${PREFIX}-relative path to the installed man pages.
###

### entries from the PLIST, and similarly for "catinstall" and catman page
### entries.

### Convert man/ to ${PKGMANDIR}/ for all man and catman page entries.
###
/^[^@]/ && $0 ~ "^man/([^/]*/)?" CATORMAN_REGEX {

###

### requested.
