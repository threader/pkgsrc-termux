# NAME
#	reduce-resolved-depends.awk -- drop redundant build dependencies
#
# SYNOPSIS
#	reduce-resolved-depends.awk
#
# DESCRIPTION
#	reduce-resolved-depends.awk removes build dependencies from the
#	dependency list on stdin, if they provided as dependency of
#	one of the full dependencies in the list.
#
# ENVIRONMENT
#	CAT
#	PKG_INFO
#	HOST_PKG_INFO (for cross-compilation)
