Integrates the letter class with fancyhdr and geometry to
automatically make letterhead stationery. Useful for writing
letters, fax, and memos. You can set up an address book using
'wrapper' macros. You put all the information for a person into
a wrapper and then put the wrapper in a document. The class
handles letterheads automatically. You place the object for the
letterhead (picture, information, etc.) in a box and all sizing
is set automatically.
