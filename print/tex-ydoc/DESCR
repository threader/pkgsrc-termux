'ydoc' provides macros and environments to document LaTeX packages and
classes.  It is an alternative to the 'ltxdoc' class and 'doc' package.  It
targets a different layout and tries to provide more modern styles (xcolor,
hyperref, etc.).

This is an alpha release. It should not be used yet for other packages.
