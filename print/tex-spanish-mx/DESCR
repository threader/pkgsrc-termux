The bundle provides files to support typesetting of texts in
Spanish according to Mexican current practices, using babel.
The files merge earlier work on a mexican.ldf, or may be used
to define a configuration that will typeset all documents (that
request babel's spanish option) to use the Mexican language
facilities. (Note that this facility is only available with the
recent (version >=4.2b) releases of the Spanish option.)
