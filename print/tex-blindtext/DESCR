The package provides the commands \blindtext and \Blindtext for
creating 'blind' text useful in testing new classes and
packages, and \blinddocument, \Blinddocument for creating an
entire random document with sections, lists, mathematics, etc.
The package supports three languages, english, (n)german and
latin; the latin option provides a short "lorem ipsum" (for a
fuller lorem ipsum text, see the lipsum package).
