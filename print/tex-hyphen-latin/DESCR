These are patterns for the latin language mainly in modern spelling (u
when u is needed and v when v is needed); medieval spelling with the
ligatures \ae and \oe and the (uncial) lowercase 'v' written as a 'u' is
also supported; apparently there is no conflict between the patterns of
modern Latin and those of medieval Latin. The patterns support the
restricted character set of the OT1-encoding (obviously without the
ligature characters), as well as T1-encoded usage.
