CUPS-PDF is a PDF writer backend for CUPS.

It is designed to produce PDF files in a heterogeneous network by providing a
PDF printer on the central fileserver. It will convert files printed to its
queue in CUPS to PDF and put them in a per-user-based directory structure.
It can execute post-processing scripts, e.g. to allow mailing the results
to the user.
