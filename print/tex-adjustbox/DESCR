The package provides several macros to adjust boxed content. One purpose is
to supplement the standard graphics package, which defines the macros
\resizebox, \scalebox and \rotatebox , with the macros\trimbox and
\clipbox. The main feature is the general \adjustbox macro which extends
the `key=value' interface of \includegraphics from the graphics package
and applies it to general text content. Additional provided box macros are
\lapbox, \marginbox, \minsizebox, \maxsizebox and \phantombox.

All macros use the collectbox package to read the content as a box and not
as a macro argument. This allows for all forms of content including special
material like verbatim content. A special feature of collectbox is used to
provide matching environments with the identical names as the macros.
