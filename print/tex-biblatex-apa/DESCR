This is a fairly complete BibLaTeX style (citations and
references) for APA (American Psychological Association)
publications. It implements and automates most of the
guidelines in the APA 6th edition style guide for citations and
references with a few (documented) exceptions (which are mainly
currently impossible to automate in principle for any BibTeX-
backed system). An example document is also given which
typesets every citation and reference example in the APA 6th
edition style guide. This version of the package requires use
of BibLaTeX v2.4 and biber v3.3 (at least).
