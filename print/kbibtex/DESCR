KBibTeX is a BibTeX editor for KDE to edit bibliographies used with
LaTeX. Features include comfortable input masks, starting web
queries (e. g. Google or PubMed) and exporting to PDF, PostScript,
RTF and XML/HTML. As KBibTeX is using KDE's KParts technology,
KBibTeX can be embedded into Kile or Konqueror.
