The command \url is a form of verbatim command that allows linebreaks
at certain characters or combinations of characters, accepts
reconfiguration, and can usually be used in the argument to another
command.  (The \urldef command provides robust commands that serve in
cases when \url doesn't work in an argument.)  The command is intended
for email addresses, hypertext links, directories/paths, etc., which
normally have no spaces, so by default the package ignores spaces in
its argument.  However, a package option "allows spaces", which is
useful for operating systems where spaces are a common part of file
names.
