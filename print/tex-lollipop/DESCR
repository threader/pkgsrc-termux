Lollipop is "TeX made easy" -- it is a macro package that
functions as a toolbox for writing TeX macros. Its main aim is
to make macro writing so easy that implementing a fully new
layout in TeX would become a matter of less than an hour for an
average document. The aim is that such a task could be
accomplished by someone with only a very basic training in TeX
programming. Thus, Lollipop aims to make structured text
formatting available in environments where typical users would
switch to WYSIWYG packages for the freedom that such a
mechanism offers. In addition, development of support for
Lollipop documents written in RTL languages (such as Persian)
is underway.
