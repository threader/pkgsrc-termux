A class and package is provided which allows TeX pictures or
other TeX code to be compiled standalone or as part of a main
document. Special support for pictures with beamer overlays is
also provided. The package is used in the main document and
skips extra preambles in sub-files. The class may be used to
simplify the preamble in sub-files. By default the preview
package is used to display the typeset code without margins.
The behaviour in standalone mode may adjusted using a
configuration file standalone.cfg to redefine the standalone
environment.
