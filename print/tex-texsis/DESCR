TeXsis is a TeX macro package which provides useful features
for typesetting research papers and related documents. For
example, it includes support specifically for: Automatic
numbering of equations, figures, tables and references;
Simplified control of type sizes, line spacing, footnotes,
running headlines and footlines, and tables of contents,
figures and tables; Specialized document formats for research
papers, preprints and ``e-prints,'' conference proceedings,
theses, books, referee reports, letters, and memoranda;
Simplified means of constructing an index for a book or thesis;
Easy to use double column formatting; Specialized environments
for lists, theorems and proofs, centered or non-justified text,
and listing computer code; Specialized macros for easily
constructing ruled tables. TeXsis was originally developed for
physicists, but others may also find it useful. It is
completely compatible with Plain TeX.
