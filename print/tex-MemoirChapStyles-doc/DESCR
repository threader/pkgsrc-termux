A showcase of chapter styles available to users of memoir: the
six provided in the class itself, plus many from elsewhere (by
the present author and others). The package's resources apply
only to memoir, but the package draws from a number of sources
relating to standard classes, including the fncychap package,
and Vincent Zoonekynd's tutorial on headings.
