The rcs package utilizes the inclusion of RCS supplied data in
LaTeX documents. It's upward compatible to *all* rcs styles I
know of. In particular, you can easily access values of every
RCS field in your document put the checkin date on the
titlepage put RCS fields in a footline You can typeset revision
logs. Not in verbatim -- real LaTeX text! But you need a
configurable RCS for that. Refer to the user manual for more
detailed information. You can also configure the rcs package
easily to do special things for any keyword. This bundle comes
with a user manual, an internal interface description, full
documentation of the implementation, style information for AUC-
TeX, and test cases.
