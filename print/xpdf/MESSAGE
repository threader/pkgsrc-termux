Upgrading from Xpdf 3.02 (and earlier)
--------------------------------------

The font configuration system has been changed.  Previous versions
used mostly separate commands to configure fonts for display and for
PostScript output.  As of 3.03, configuration options that make sense
for both display and PS output have been unified.

The following xpdfrc commands have been removed:
* displayFontT1, displayFontTT: replaced with fontFile
* displayNamedCIDFontT1, displayNamedCIDFontTT: replaced with fontFile
* displayCIDFontT1, displayCIDFontTT: replaced with fontFileCC
* psFont: replaced with psResidentFont
* psNamedFont16: replaced with psResidentFont16
* psFont16: replaced with psResidentFontCC

See the xpdfrc(5) man page for more information on the new commands.
