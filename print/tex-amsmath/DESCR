This package is the principal package in the AMS-LaTeX distribution.
It adapts for use in LaTeX most of the mathematical features found in
AMS-TeX; it is a near-indispensable adjunct to serious mathematical
typesetting in LaTeX.  When amsmath is loaded, AMS-LaTeX packages
amsbsy (for bold symbols), amsopn (for operator names) and amstext
(for text embdedded in mathematics) are also loaded.  Amsmath is part
of the LaTeX required distribution; however, several contributed
packages add still further to its appeal; examples are empheq, which
provides functions for decorating and highlighting mathematics, and
ntheorem, for specifying theorem (and similar) definitions.
