The package deals with the behaviour of the LaTeX internal command
\@ifnextchar, which skips blank spaces. This has the potential to
surprise users, since it can produce really unwanted effects. A common
example occurs with brackets starting a line following \\: the command
looks for an optional argument, whereas the user wants the brackets to
be printed.

The package offers commands and options for modifying this behaviour,
maybe limited to certain parts of the document source.
