This package offers commands to use and switch between chess
fonts. It uses the LaTeX font selection scheme (nfss). The
package doesn't parse, format and print PGN input like e.g. the
packages skak or texmate; the aim of the package is to offer
writers of chess packages a bundle of commands for fonts, so
that they don't have to implement all these commands for
themselves. A normal user can use the package to print e.g.
single chess symbols and simple diagrams. The documentation
contains also a section about installation of chess fonts.
