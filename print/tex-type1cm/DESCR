LaTeX, by default, restricts the sizes at which you can use its
default computer modern fonts, to a fixed set of discrete sizes
(effectively, a set specified by Knuth).  The type1cm package removes
this restriction; this is particularly useful when using scalable
versions of the cm fonts (Bakoma, or the versions from BSR/Y&Y, or
True Type versions from Kinch, PCTeX, etc.).  In fact, since modern
distributions will automatically generate any bitmap font you might
need, type1cm has wider application than just those using scaleable
versions of the fonts.  Note that the LaTeX distribution now contains
a package fix-cm, which performs the task of type1cm, as well as doing
the same job for T1- and TS1-encoded ec fonts.
