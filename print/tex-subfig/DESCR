The package provides support for the manipulation and reference of small
or `sub' figures and tables within a single figure or table
environment.  It is convenient to use this package when your subfigures
are to be separately captioned, referenced, or are to be included in the
List-of-Figures.  A new \subfigure command is introduced which can be
used inside a figure environment for each subfigure.  An optional first
argument is used as the caption for that subfigure.  This package
supersedes the subfigure package (which will continue to be supported,
but no longer maintained).  The name has changed because the subfig
package is not completely backward compatible with the older subfigure
package due to an extensive rewrite to use the new caption package to
produce its subcaptions.  The major advantage to the new package is that
the user interface is keyword/value driven and easier to use.  To ease
the transition from the subfigure package it includes a configuration
file (subfig.cfg) which nearly emulates the subfigure package.
