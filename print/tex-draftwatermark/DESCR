The "draftwatermark" package provides a means to add a textual,
light grey watermark on every page or on the first page of a document.
Typical usage may consist in writing words such as DRAFT or
CONFIDENTIAL across document pages. The package performs a similar
function to that of draftcopy, but its implementation is output
device independent, and very made simple by relying on everpage.
