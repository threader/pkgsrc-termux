The class formats documents in APA style (6th Edition). It
provides a full set of facilities in three different output
modes (journal-like appearance, double-spaced manuscript,
LaTeX-like document), in contrast to the earlier apa6e, which
only formats double-spaced manuscripts in APA style. The class
can mask author identity for copies for use in masked peer
review. The class is a development of the apa class (which is
no longer maintained).
