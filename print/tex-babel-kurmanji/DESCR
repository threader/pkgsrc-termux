The package provides the language definition file for support
of Kurmanji in babel. Kurmanji belongs to the family of Kurdish
languages. Some shortcuts are defined, as well as translations
to Kurmanji of standard "LaTeX names". Note that the package is
dealing with 'Northern' Kurdish, written using a Latin-based
alphabet. The arabxetex package offers support for Kurdish
written in Arabic script.
