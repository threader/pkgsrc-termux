The glossaries package supports acronyms and multiple glossaries, and
has provision for operation in several languages (using the facilities
of either babel or polyglossia). New entries are defined to have a name
and description (and optionally an associated symbol). Support for
multiple languages is offered, and plural forms of terms may be
specified. An additional package, glossaries-accsupp, can make use of
the accsupp package mechanisms for accessibility support for PDF files
containing glossaries. The user may define new glossary styles, and
preambles and postambles can be specified. There is provision for
loading a database of terms, but only terms used in the text will be
added to the relevant glossary. The package uses an indexing program to
provide the actual glossary; either makeindex or xindy may serve this
purpose, and a Perl script is provided to serve as interface. The
package distribution also provides the mfirstuc package, for changing
the first letter of a word to upper case. The package supersedes the
author's glossary package (which is now obsolete), and a conversion tool
is provided.
