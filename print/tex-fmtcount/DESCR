The package fmtcount.sty provides commands that display the value of a
LaTeX counter in a variety of formats (ordinal, text, hexadecimal,
decimal, octal, binary etc). The package offers some multilingual
support; configurations for use in English (both British and American
usage), French, German, Portuguese and Spanish documents are provided.
This package was originally provided as part of the author's datetime
package, but is now distributed separately.
