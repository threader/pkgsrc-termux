Gutenprint is a package of high quality printer drivers for Linux,
BSD, Solaris, IRIX, and other UNIX-alike operating systems. In many
cases, these drivers rival or exceed the OEM drivers in quality and
functionality. Our goal is to produce the highest possible output
quality from all supported printers. To that end, we have done
extensive work on screening algorithms, color generation, and printer
feature utilization. We are continuing our work in all of these areas
to produce ever higher quality results, particularly on the
ubiquitous, inexpensive inkjet printers that are nonetheless capable
of nearly photographic output quality.  Earlier versions of Gutenprint
were called gimp-print.

This package contains the base library, the Epson utility escputil,
cups support, and a gimp plugin.
