A powerfully extended version of the plain format, adding
support for bibliographies, tables of contents, enumerated
lists, verbatim input of files, numbered equations, tables, two-
column output, footnotes, hyperlinks in PDF output and
commutative diagrams. Eplain can also load some of the more
useful LaTeX packages, notably graphics, graphicx, color,
autopict (a package instance of the LaTeX picture code),
psfrag, and url.
