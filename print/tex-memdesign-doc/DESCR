"A Few Notes on Book Design" provides an introduction to the
business of book design. It is an extended version of what used
to be the first part of the memoir users' manual. Please note
that the compiled copy, supplied in the package, uses
commercial fonts; the README file contains instructions on how
to compile the document without these fonts.
