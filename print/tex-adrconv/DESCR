Adrconv is a collection of BibTeX style files to turn an
address database stored in the .bib format into files suitable
for printing as address books or included into letter classes
like akletter or scrletter2. Adrconv will sort the data either
by name or birthday and create output files in various formats
for address books or time planers.
