Provides the H option for floats in LaTeX to signify that the environemt
is not really a float (and should therefore be placed "here" and not
float at all). The package emulates an older package of the same name,
which has long been been suppressed by its author. The job is done by
nothing more than loading the float package, which has long provided the
option in an acceptable framework.
