The package provides an \ul (underline) command will break over line
ends; this technique may be used to replace \em (both in that form and
as the \emph command), so as to make output look as if it comes from a
typewriter.  The package also offers double and wavy underlining, and
striking out (line through words) and crossing out (/// over words).
Documentation is to be found in the package file itself.
