The octavo class is a modification of the standard LaTeX book class.
Its purpose is to typeset books following classical design and
layout principles, with the express intention of encouraging the
making of beautiful books by anyone with access to a good printer
and with an inclination towards venerable crafts, e.g., bookbinding.

The octavo class differs from the book class by implementing many
of the proposals and insights of respected experts, especially Jan
Tschichold and Hugh Williamson.

The documentation discusses methods to organise and print out any
text into signatures, which can then be gathered, folded and sewn
into a book.
