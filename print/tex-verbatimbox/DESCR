The package provides a verbbox environment (which uses techniques similar
to those of the boxedverbatim environment of the moreverb package)
to place its contents into a globally available box, or into a box
specified by the user.

The global box may then be used in a variety of situations (for example,
providing a replica of the boxedverbatim environment itself). A valuable
use is in places where the standard verbatim environment (which is based
on a trivlist) may not appear.
