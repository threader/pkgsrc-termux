The pmw command has been installed in ${BINDIR}. The PostScript header
file, the PostScript music fonts, and the fontmetrics files have been
installed in ${DATADIR}. The man page has been installed in
${MANDIR}.

If you use the -includefont option with the pmw command, the output file
includes the PMW-Music font (and the PMW-Alpha font, if it was referenced),
and you should be able to view the output using Ghostscript without any
special configuration.

If you want to be able to use GhostScript to view music without having
to include the music fonts in every output file, you have to make the
fonts available to Ghostscript. To do this, run the command

  ${GS} -h

and find a suitable font directory in the 'Search path' data. Then

  ln -s ${DATADIR}/psfonts/PMW-Alpha /that/dir/PMW-Alpha
  ln -s ${DATADIR}/psfonts/PMW-Music.pfa /that/dir/PMW-Music.pfa

If that does not work, you may have an older version of Ghostscript.
Refer to the PMW manual ${SPECPDF} for further
information.
