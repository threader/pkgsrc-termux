This package provides a method for defining category code table
stacks in LuaTeX. It builds on code provided by the 2015/10/01
release of LaTeX2e (also available as ltluatex.sty for plain
users). It is required by the luatexbase package (v1.0 onward)
which uses ctablestack to provide a back-compatibility form of
this concept.
