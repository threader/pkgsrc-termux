A development of TeX, which deals in multi-octet Unicode
characters, to enable native treatment of a wide range of
languages without changing character-set. Work on Omega seems,
more or less, to have ceased: its immediate successor was to be
the aleph project (though that too has stalled). Projects
developing Omega (and Aleph) ideas include Omega-2 and LuaTeX.
