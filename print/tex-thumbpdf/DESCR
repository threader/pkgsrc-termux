A Perl script that provides support for thumbnails in pdfTeX
and dvips/ps2pdf. The script uses ghostscript to generate the
thumbnails which get represented in a TeX readable file that is
read by the package thumbpdf.sty to automatically include the
thumbnails. This arrangement works with both plain TeX and
LaTeX.
