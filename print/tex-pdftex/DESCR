An extension of TeX which can be configured to directly
generate PDF documents instead of DVI. All current free TeX
distributionsm including TeX live, MacTeX and MiKTeX include
pdfTeX (Plain TeX) and pdfLaTeX (LaTeX). ConTeXt was designed
around use of pdfTeX (though it is now migrating towards
LuaTeX).
