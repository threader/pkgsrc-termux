Prosper is a LaTeX class for writing transparencies. It is written as an
extension of the seminar class by Timothy Van Zandt. Prosper offers a
friendly environment for creating slides for both presentations with an
overhead projector and a video projector. Slides prepared for a
presentation with a computer and a video projector may integrate
animation effects, incremental display, and so on. Various visual styles
are supported (including some that mimic PowerPoint) and others are
being contributed.
