The package allows the user to include several bibliographies covering
different 'topics' or bibliographic material into a document (e.g., one
bibliography for primary literature and one for secondary literature).
The package provides commands to include either all references from a
.bib file, only the references actually cited or those not cited in your
document. The user has to construct a separate .bib file for each
bibliographic 'topic', each of which will be processed separately by
BibTeX. If you want to have bibliographies specific to one part of a
document, see the packages bibunits or chapterbib.
