The package's principal command, \diagbox, takes two arguments
(texts for the slash-separated parts of the box), and an
optional argument with which the direction the slash will go,
the box dimensions, etc., may be controlled. The package also
provides \slashbox and \backslashbox commands for compatibility
with the slashbox package, which it supersedes.
