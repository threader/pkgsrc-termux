This package provides support for the manipulation and reference of
small or `sub' figures and tables within a single figure or table
environment.  It is convenient to use this package when your
subfigures are to be separately captioned, referenced, or are to be
included in the List-of-Figures.  A new \subfigure command is
introduced which can be used inside a figure environment for each
subfigure.  An optional first argument is used as the caption for that
subfigure.  This package is now obsolescent; new users should use
tex-subfig instead.
