The package enhances LaTeX's cross-referencing features,
allowing the format of references to be determined
automatically according to the type of reference. The formats
used may be customised in the preamble of a document; babel
support is available (though the choice of languages remains
limited: currently Danish, Dutch, English, French, German,
Italian, Norwegian, Russian, Spanish and Ukranian). The package
also offers a means of referencing a list of references, each
formatted according to its type. In such lists, it can collapse
sequences of numerically-consecutive labels to a reference
range.
