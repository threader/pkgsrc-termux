The package provides the language definition file for support
of Latin in babel. Translations to Latin (in both modern and
medieval spelling) of standard "LaTeX names", and some
shortcuts, are provided. Apart from the modern vs. medieval
setting, a further switch permits addition of prosodic marks.
