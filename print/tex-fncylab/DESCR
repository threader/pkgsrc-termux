LaTeX provides a mechanism for altering the appearance of references
to labels, but it's somewhat flawed, and requires that the user
manipulate internal commands.  The package fixes the flaw in LaTeX,
and provides a \labelformat command for changing the format of
references to labels.  The package also provides a \Ref command to
make reference to such redefined labels at the start of a sentence.
