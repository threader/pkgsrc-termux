The LaTeX::Driver module encapsulates the details of invoking the Latex
programs to format a LaTeX document. Formatting with LaTeX is complicated;
there are potentially many programs to run and the output of those programs
must be monitored to determine whether further processing is required.

This module runs the required commands in the directory specified, either
explicitly with the dirname option or implicitly by the directory part of
basename, or in the current directory. As a result of the processing up to
a dozen or more intermediate files are created. These can be removed with
the cleanup method.
