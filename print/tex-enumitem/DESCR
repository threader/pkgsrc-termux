This package provides user control over the layout of the three basic
list environments: enumerate, itemize, and description.  It supersedes
both enumerate and mdwlist (providing well- structured replacements
for all their funtionality), and in addition provides functions to
compute the layout of labels, and to `clone' the standard
environments, to create new environments with counters of their own.
