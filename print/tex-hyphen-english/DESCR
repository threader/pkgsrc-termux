Additional hyphenation patterns for American and British
English in ASCII encoding.  The American English patterns
(usenglishmax) greatly extend the standard patterns from Knuth
to find many additional hyphenation points.  British English
hyphenation is completely different from US English, so has its
own set of patterns.
