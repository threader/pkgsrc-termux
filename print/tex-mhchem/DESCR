Currently, the mhchem bundle consists of two packages: mhchem and
rsphrase. The mhchem package provides two commands: one for typesetting
chemical molecular formulae and one for typesetting chemical equations
with these formulae. The rsphrase package contains the text of all
official Risk and Safety (R and S) Phrases that are used to label
chemicals. At the time being, these phrases are available in Danish,
English, French, German (current spelling), and Spanish.
