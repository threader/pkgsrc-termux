The package offers the placement of background material on the
pages of a document. The user can control many aspects
(contents, position, color, opacity) of the background material
that will be displayed; all placement and attribute settings
are controlled by setting key values. The package makes use of
the everypage package, and uses pgf/tikz for attribute control.
