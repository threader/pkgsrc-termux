This package provides a scheme for tables that have a structured note
section, after the caption.  This scheme provides an answer to the old
problem of putting footnotes in tables---by making footnotes entirely
unnecessary.  Note that a threeparttable is not a float of itself; but
you can place it in a table or a table* environment, if necessary.
