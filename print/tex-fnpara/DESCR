This package typesets footnotes in run-on paragraphs, instead of one
above another; this is a re-seating, for the LaTeX environment, of an
example in the TeXbook.  The same basic code, improved for use in
e-TeX-based LaTeX, appears in the comprehensive footnote package
footmisc, and superior versions are also available in the manyfoot and
bigfoot packages.
