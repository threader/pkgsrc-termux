The package supports compressed, sorted lists of numerical citations,
and also deals with various punctuation and other issues of
representation, including comprehensive management of break points. The
package is compatible with both hyperref and backref. The package is
(unsurprisingly) part of the cite bundle of the author's
citation-related packages.
