This package defines macros \includeversion{NAME} and
\excludeversion{NAME}, each of which defines an environment NAME whose
text is to be included or excluded from compilation.  Although the
command syntax is very similar to that of comment, comment.sty is to
be preferred to version.sty for documents where significant chunks of
text may be excluded.
