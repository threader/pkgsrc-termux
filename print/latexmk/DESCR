LatexMk completely automates the process of generating a LaTeX document.
Essentially, it is a highly specialized relative of the general make
utility.  Given the source files for a document, latexmk issues the
appropriate sequence of commands to generate a .dvi, .ps, .pdf or hardcopy
version of the document.  It will run LaTeX the correct number of times to
resolve cross references, and run auxiliary programs (bibtex, makeindex) if
necessary. It can also be set to run continuously with a previewer, in which
case the needed commands are re-run whenever one of the source files is
modified.
