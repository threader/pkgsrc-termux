LaTeX is a widely-used macro package for TeX, providing many basic
document formating commands extended by a wide range of packages.  It
is a development of Leslie Lamport's original LaTeX 2.09, and
superseded the older system in June 1994.

This package provides the following commands: latex, lualatex,
pdflatex, and dvilualatex.
