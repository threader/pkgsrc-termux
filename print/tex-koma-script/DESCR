The KOMA-Script bundle provides drop-in replacements for the
article/report/book classes with emphasis on typography and
versatility.  There is also a letter class, different from all other
letter classes.  It also offers e.g. a package for calculated type
areas in the way laid down by the typographer Jan Tschichold, a
package for easily changing and defining of page styles, a package for
getting not only the current date but also the name of day and a
package for getting current time.  All these packages may be used not
only with KOMA-Script classes but also with standard classes.  Since
every package has its own version number, the number below is only the
version of scrbook, scrreprt, scrartcl, scrlttr2, and typearea.  These
are the main parts of the bundle.
