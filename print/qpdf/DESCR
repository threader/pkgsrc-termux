QPDF is a command-line program that does structural, content-preserving
transformations on PDF files.  It could have been called something like
pdf-to-pdf. It also provides many useful capabilities to developers of
PDF-producing software or for people who just want to look at the innards of a
PDF file to learn more about how they work.

QPDF is capable of creating linearized (also known as web-optimized) files and
encrypted files. It is also capable of converting PDF files with object streams
(also known as compressed objects) to files with no compressed objects or to
generate object streams from files that don't have them (or even those that
already do). QPDF also supports a special mode designed to allow you to edit the
content of PDF files in a text editor. For more details, please see the
documentation links below.

QPDF includes support for merging and splitting PDFs through the ability to copy
objects from one PDF file into another and to manipulate the list of pages in a
PDF file. The QPDF library also makes it possible for you to create PDF files
from scratch. In this mode, you are responsible for supplying all the contents
of the file, while the QPDF library takes care off all the syntactical
representation of the objects, creation of cross references tables and, if you
use them, object streams, encryption, linearization and other syntactic details.
