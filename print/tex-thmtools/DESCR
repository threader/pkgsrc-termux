The bundle provides several packages for commonly-needed
support for typesetting theorems. The packages should work with
kernel theorems (theorems 'out of the box' with LaTeX), and the
theorem and amsthm packages. Features of the bundle include: a
key-value interface to \newtheorem; a \listoftheorems command;
hyperref and autoref compatibility; a mechanism for restating
entire theorems in a single macro call.
