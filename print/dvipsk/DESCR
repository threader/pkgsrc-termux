dvips takes a DVI file file[.dvi] produced by TeX (or by some other
processor such as GFtoDVI) and converts it to PostScript, normally
sending the result directly to the (laser)printer.  The DVI file may
be specified without the .dvi extension.  Fonts used may either be
resident in the printer or defined as bitmaps in PK files, or a
`virtual' combination of both.  If the mktexpk program is installed,
dvips will automatically invoke METAFONT to generate fonts that don't
already exist.
