This package provides macros and fonts in Metafont format which
can be used to typeset chess games using PGN, and to show
diagrams of the current board in a document. The package builds
on work by Piet Tutelaers -- the main novelty is the use of PGN
for input instead of the more cumbersome coordinate notation
(g1f3 becomes the more readable Nf3 in PGN). An Adobe Type 1
implementation of skak's fonts is available as package skaknew;
an alternative chess notational scheme is available in package
texmate, and a general mechanism for selecting chess fonts is
provided in chessfss.
