A LaTeX package to print a regular grid of ragged-right labels
on a page, suitable for sheets of labels which can be fed
through a printer. Macros are provided to allow easy input of
names and addresses in a form free of TeX markup. Equally
useful is a feature for making multiple copies of a single
label, e.g., return address stickers to go with the labels.
Rows, columns, borders can all be specified to match the label
sheet being used.
