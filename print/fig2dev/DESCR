You need the fig2dev program in addition to xfig to be complete.
Xfig saves figures in its own, proprietary .fig format. The fig2dev
program allows you to print and export figures. Fig2dev translates
the .fig files to various languages and formats such as PostScript,
png, jpeg, pstricks, tikz, etc.
