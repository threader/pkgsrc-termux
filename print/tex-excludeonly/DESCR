The package defines an \excludeonly command, which is (in effect) the
opposite of \includeonly.  If both \includeonly and \excludeonly exist
in a document, only files "allowed" by both will be included.  The
package redefines the internal \@include command, so it conflicts with
packages that do the same.  Examples are the classes paper.cls and
thesis.cls.
