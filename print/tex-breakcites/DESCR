This LaTeX package makes a very minor change to the operation of the
\cite command.  Note that the change is not necessary in unmodified
LaTeX; however, there remain packages that restore the undesirable
behavior of the command as provided in LaTeX 2.09. (Note that neither
cite nor natbib make this mistake.)
