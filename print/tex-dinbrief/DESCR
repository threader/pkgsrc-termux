Implements a document layout for writing letters according to
the rules of DIN (Deutsches Institut fur Normung, German
standardisation institute). A style file for LaTeX 2.09 (with
limited support of the features) is part of the package. Since
the letter layout is based on a German standard, the user guide
is written in German, but most macros have English names from
which the user can recognize what they are used for. In
addition there are example files showing how letters may be
created with the package. A graphical interface for use of the
dinbrief is provided in the dinbrief-GUI bundle.
