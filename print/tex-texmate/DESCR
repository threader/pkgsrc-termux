TeXmate formats chess games from very simple ascii input. The
clean "1. e4 e5; 2. Nf3 Nc6; 3. Bb5 a6" will produce the same
results as the sloppier "1 e4 e5; Nf3 Nc6 3.. Bb5 a6". The
resulting format is fully customizable. There are 4 levels of
commentary: 1 is the main game, 2-3 are commentaries. Each has
its fonts, punctuation marks, etc., and these are also
customizable. The package includes a tool for the creation of
diagrams. The package works in conjunction with skak to produce
diagrams of the current position automatically. For chess
fonts, the package uses the chessfss system.
