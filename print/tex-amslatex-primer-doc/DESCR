The document aims to get you up and running with AMS-LaTeX as
quickly as possible. These instructions (along with a template
file template.tex) are not a substitute for the full
documentation, but they may get you started quickly enough so
that you will only need to refer to the main documentation
occasionally. In addition to 'AMS-LaTeX out of the box', the
document contains: a section describing how to draw commutative
diagrams using Xy-pic; and a section describing how to use
amsrefs to create a bibliography.
