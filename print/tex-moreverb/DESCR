A collection of verbatim facilities that provide line-numbered
verbatim, verbatim that obey's TAB characters, verbatim input and
verbatim output to file.  The package makes use of the LaTeX required
verbatim package.  The package formed from a series of small pieces,
and is somewhat unstructured.  The user who looks for thought-through
verbatim facilities is advised to consider using the fancyvrb package
in place of moreverb.
