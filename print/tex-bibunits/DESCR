The package provide a mechanism to generate separate
bibliographies for different units (chapters, sections or
bibunit-environments) of a text. The package separates the
citations of each unit of text into a separate file to be
processed by BibTeX. The global bibliography section produced
by LaTeX may also appear in the document and citations can be
placed in both the local unit and the global bibliographies at
the same time. The package is compatible with koma-script and
with the babel French option frenchb.
