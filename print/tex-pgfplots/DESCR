Pgfplots draws high-quality function plots using normal or logarithmic
scaling, with a user-friendly interface.  The user supplies axis
labels, legend entries and the plot coordinates for one or more plots
and Pgfplots applies axis scaling, computes any logarithms and axis
ticks and draws the plots.  Pgfplots is based on Till Tantau's package
PGF/TikZ.
