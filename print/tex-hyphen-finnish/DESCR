Two sets of hyphenation patterns are provided; fihyph.tex, and
fi8hyph.tex (which is modified from fihyph.tex to make the Finnish
accented letters to work with LaTeX2e, adding some \catcode, \uccode,
and \lccode commands after the model used in the hyphenation files for
the other European languages). The package is superseded by the Finnish
patterns available in the hyph-utf8 bundle.
