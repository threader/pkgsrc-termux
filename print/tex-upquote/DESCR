Typewriter-style fonts are best for program listings, but
Computer Modern Typewriter prints ` and ' as bent opening and
closing single quotes. Other fonts, and most programming
languages, print ` as a grave accent and ' upright; ' is used
both to open and to close quoted strings. The package switches
the typewriter font to Computer Modern Typewriter in OT1
encoding, and modifies the behaviour of verbatim, verbatim*,
\verb, and \verb* to print in the "` and ' way". It does
thisregardless of other fonts or encodings in use, so long as
the package is loaded after the other fonts were. The package
does not affect \tt, \texttt, etc.
