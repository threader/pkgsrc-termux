A class that produces overhead slides (transparencies), with many
facilities. The class requires availability of the fancybox package.
Seminar is also the basis of other classes, such as prosper. In fact,

users are advised to use more recent classes such as powerdot or beamer,
both of which are tuned to 21st-century presentation styles. Note that
the seminar distribution relies on the xcomment package, which was once
part of the bundle, but now has a separate existence.
