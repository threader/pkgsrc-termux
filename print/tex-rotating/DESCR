A package built on the standard LaTeX graphics package to perform all
the different sorts of rotation one might like, including complete
figures and tables with their captions.  If you want continuous text
(i.e., more than one page) set in landscape mode, use the lscape
package instead.  The rotating packages only deals in rotated boxes
(or floats, which are themselves boxes), and boxes always stay on one
page.  If you need to use the facilities of the float in the same
document, load rotating.sty via rotfloat, which smooths the path
between the rotating and float packages.
