Improves the interface for defining floating objects such as figures
and tables.  Introduces the boxed float, the ruled float and the
plaintop float.  You can define your own floats and improve the
behaviour of the old ones.  The package also provides the H float
modifier option of the obsolete here package.  You can select this as
automatic default with \floatplacement{figure}{H}.
