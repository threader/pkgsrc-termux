This package serves as a drop-in replacement for the packages
ocgx by Paul Gaborit and ocg-p by Werner Moshammer for the
creation of PDF Layers. It re-implements the functionality of
the ocg, ocgx, and ocg-p packages and adds support for all
known engines and back-ends including: LaTeX - dvips -
ps2pdf/Distiller (Xe)LaTeX(x) - dvipdfmx pdfLaTeX and LuaLaTeX
. It also ensures compatibility with the media9 and animate
packages.
