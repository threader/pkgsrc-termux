The package provides macros for manipulating strings -- testing
a string's contents, extracting substrings, substitution of
substrings and providing numbers such as string length,
position of, or number of recurrences of, a substring. The
package works equally in Plain TeX and LaTeX (though e-TeX is
always required). The strings to be processed may contain
(expandable) macros.
