Typeset programs (programming code) within LaTeX.  The source code is
read directly by TeX.  Keywords, comments and strings can be typeset
using different styles (default is bold for keywords, italic for
comments and no special style for strings).  Includes support for
hyperref.  To use, simply \usepackage{listings}, identify the language
with \lstset{language=Python}, then employ the \begin{lstlisting} ...
\end{lstlisting} environment or the \lstinputlisting{filename.py}
command.  Short (in-line) listings are also available, using either
\lstinline|...| or | ... | (after defining the | token with the
\lstMakeShortInline command).
