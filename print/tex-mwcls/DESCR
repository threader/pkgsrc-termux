mwcls is a set of document classes for LaTeX 2e designed with
Polish typographical tradition in mind. Classes include:
'mwart' (which is a replacement for 'article'), 'mwrep'
(replacing 'report'), and 'mwbk' (replacing 'book'). Most
features present in standard classes work with mwcls classes.
Some extensions/exceptions include: sectioning commands allow
for second optional argument (it is possible to state different
texts for running head and for TOC), new environments
'itemize*' and 'enumerate*' for lists with long items, page
styles have variants for normal, opening, closing, and blank
pages.
