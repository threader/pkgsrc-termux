Places the word DRAFT (or other words) in light grey diagonally
across the background (or at the bottom) of each (or selected)
pages of the document. The package uses PostScript \special
commands, and may not therefore be used with PDFLaTeX. For that
usage, consider the wallpaper or draftwatermark packages.
