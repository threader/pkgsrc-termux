The package creates three environments:
  - framed, which puts an ordinary frame box around the region,
  - shaded, which shades the region, and
  - leftbar, which places a line at the left side.

The environments allow a break at their start (the \FrameCommand
enables creation of a title that is "attached" to the environment);
breaks are also allowed in the course of the framed/shaded
matter. There is also a command \MakeFramed to make your own
framed-style environments.
