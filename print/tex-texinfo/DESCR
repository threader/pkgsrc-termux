Texinfo is the preferred format for documentation in the GNU
project; the format may be used to produce online or printed
output from a single source. The Texinfo macros may be used to
produce printable output using TeX; other programs in the
distribution offer online interactive use (with hypertext
linkages in some cases). Note that a developers' snapshot of
the latest release of the Texinfo macros may be found in the
Texinfo 'latest' package.
