The memoir class is for typesetting poetry, fiction, non-fiction, and
mathematical works.  The normal font sizes range from 9 to 60pt.  There is
a range of page-styles and well over a dozen chapter-styles to choose
from and methods for specifying your own layouts and designs.  The class
encompasses over thirty of the more popular packages.  The class has an
associated patch file mempatch, which is automatically loaded by the
class itself, and which is updated from time to time, between releases
of the class itself.  (The patch file still exists if there are no extant
patches.)
