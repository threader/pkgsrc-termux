The package provides the language definition file for support
of North Sami in babel. (Several Sami dialects/languages are
spoken in Finland, Norway, Sweden and on the Kola Peninsula of
Russia). Not all use the same alphabet, and no attempt is made
to support any other than North Sami here. Some shortcuts are
defined, as well as translations to Norsk of standard "LaTeX
names".
