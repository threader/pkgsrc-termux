The package provides macros to collect and process a macro argument (i.e.,
something which looks like a macro argument) as a horizontal box rather than
as a real macro argument.

The `arguments' are stored as if they had been saved by \savebox or by the
lrbox environment. Grouping tokens \bgroup and \egroup may be used, which
allows the user to have the beginning and end of a group in different macro
invocations, or to place them in the begin and end code of an
environment. Arguments may contain verbatim material or other special use of
characters.

The macros were designed for use within other macros.
