This bundle is a combined distribution consisting of dvips.def,
pdftex.def, luatex.def, xetex.def, dvipdfmx.def, and
dvisvgm.def driver option files for the LaTeX graphics and
color packages. It is hoped that by combining their source
repositories at https://github.com/latex3/graphics-def it will
be easier to coordinate updates.
