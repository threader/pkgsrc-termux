The bundle consists of: a tool for collecting text for later
re-use, a tool for typesetting the "meta-information" within a
text, a tool for use in constructing macros with multiple
optional parameters, a package for multiple column parallel
texts, a tool for processing key-value structured lists, and
macros for typesetting a number as a German-language string.
