Provides a Plain TeX macro \figflow that allows one to insert a
figure into an area inset into a paragraph. Command arguments
are width and height of the figure, and the figure (and its
caption) itself. Usage details are to be found in the TeX file
itself. The package does not work with LaTeX; packages such as
wrapfig, floatflt and picins support the needs of LaTeX users
in this area.
