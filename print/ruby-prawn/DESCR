= Prawn: Fast, Nimble PDF Generation For Ruby

Prawn is a PDF writing library for Ruby designed to be tiny, fast, and nimble,
just like the majestic sea creature.

Development on this library was initially made possible thanks to
the many people who donated to the Ruby Mendicant project:
http://rubymendicant.wikidot.com

The project is currently maintained by Gregory Brown, with lots of help from
Prawn's core developers and the community.
