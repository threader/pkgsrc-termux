The package allows the user to input formatted data into elements of a
2-D or 3-D array and to recall that data at will by individual cell
number. The data can be but need not be numerical in nature. It can be,
for example, formatted text.

While the package can be used for any application where indexed data is
called for, the package proves particularly useful when elements of
multiple arrays must be recallable and dynamically combined at time of
compilation, rather than in advance.
