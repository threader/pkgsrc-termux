The PDF::Reader library implements a PDF parser conforming as much as
possible to the PDF specification from Adobe.

It provides programmatic access to the contents of a PDF file with
a high degree of flexibility.

The PDF 1.7 specification is a weighty document and not all aspects
are currently supported. I welcome submission of PDF files that
exhibit unsupported aspects of the spec to assist with improving out
support.
