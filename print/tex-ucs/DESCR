This bundle provides the ucs package, and utf8x.def, together with a
large number of support files. The utf8x.def definition file for use
with inputenc covers a wider range of Unicode characters than does
utf8.def in the LaTeX distribution. The ucs package provides facilities
for efficient use of large sets of Unicode characters.
