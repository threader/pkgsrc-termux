Algorithm2e is an environment for writing algorithms. An algorithm
becomes a floating object (like figure, table, etc.). The package
provides macros that allow you to create different keywords, and a set
of predefined key words is provided; you can change the typography of
the keywords. The package allows vertical lines delimiting a block of
instructions in an algorithm, and defines different sorts of algorithms
such as Procedure or Function; the name of these functions may be reused
in the text or in other algorithms.
