CJK is a macro package for LaTeX, providing simultaneous support for
various Asian scripts in many encodings (including Unicode): Chinese
(both traditional and simplified), Japanese, Korean, and Thai. A
special add-on feature is an interface to the Emacs editor
(cjk-enc.el) which gives simultaneous, easy-to-use support to a bunch
of other scripts in addition to the above: Cyrillic, Greek,
Latin-based scripts, Russian, and Vietnamese.
