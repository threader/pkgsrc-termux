LaTeX's standard styles use two page styles, one on normal pages and
one on 'opening' pages with \maketitle or \chapter, etc.
Unfortunately there is only easy access to changing one of these two
so if you want something other than 'plain' on the opening pages you
must use \thispagestyle on each such page.  The fancyhdr package does
provide a more flexible interface, but if you just want an empty page
style on all pages then this package will do the job.
