A collection of ways to change the typesetting of footnotes.  The
package provides means of changing the layout of the footnotes
themselves (including setting them in `paragraphs'--the para option),
a way to number footnotes per page (the perpage option), to make
footnotes disappear when an argument moves (stable option) and to deal
with multiple references to footnotes from the same place (multiple
option).  The package also has a range of techniques for labelling
footnotes with symbols rather than numbers.  Some of the functions of
the package are overlap with the functionality of other packages.  The
para option is also provided by the manyfoot and bigfoot packages,
though those are both also portmanteau packages.  (Don't be seduced by
fnpara, whose implementation is improved by the present package.)  The
perpage option is also offered by footnpag and by the rather more
general-purpose perpage.
