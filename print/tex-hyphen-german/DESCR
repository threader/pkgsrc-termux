Hyphenation patterns for German in T1/EC and UTF-8 encodings,
for traditional and reformed spelling, including Swiss German.
The package includes the latest patterns from dehyph-exptl
(known to TeX under names 'german', 'ngerman' and
'swissgerman'), however 8-bit engines still load old versions
of patterns for 'german' and 'ngerman' for backward-
compatibility reasons. Swiss German patterns are suitable for
Swiss Standard German (Hochdeutsch) not the Alemannic dialects
spoken in Switzerland (Schwyzerduetsch). There are no known
patterns for written Schwyzerduetsch.
