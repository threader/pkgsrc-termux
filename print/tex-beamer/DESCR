The beamer LaTeX class can be used for producing slides. Its
functionality is similar to Prosper but does not need any
external programs and can directly produce a presentation using
pdflatex. Beamer uses pgf for pdf/ps independent graphics.
Frames are created using \frame{...}, and a frame can build
multiple slides through a simple notation for specifying
material for each slide within a frame. Beamer supports
bibliographies, appendicies and transitions. Short versions of
title, authors, institute can also be specified as optional
parameters. A \plainframe{} allows a picture, for example, to
fill the whole frame. Support figure and table environments,
transparency effects, a \transduration command, animation
commands, a pauses environment. Beamer also provides
compatibility with other packages like prosper.
