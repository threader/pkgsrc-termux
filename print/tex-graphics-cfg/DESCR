This bundle includes color.cfg and graphics.cfg files that set
default "driver" options for the color and graphics packages.
It contains support for defaulting the new LuaTeX option which
was added to graphics and color in the 2016-02-01 release. The
LuaTeX option is only used for LuaTeX versions from 0.87, older
versions use the pdfTeX option as before.
