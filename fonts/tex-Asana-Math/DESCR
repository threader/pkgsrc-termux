The Asana-Math font is an OpenType font that includes almost
all mathematical Unicode symbols and it can be used to typeset
mathematical text with any software that can understand the
MATH OpenType table (e.g., XeTeX 0.997 and Microsoft Word
2007). The font is beta software. Typesetting support for use
with LaTeX is provided by the fontspec and unicode-math
packages.
