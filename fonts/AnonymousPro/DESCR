Anonymous Pro (2009) is a family of four fixed-width fonts designed
especially with coding in mind. Characters that could be mistaken
for one another (O, 0, I, l, 1, etc.) have distinct shapes to make
them easier to tell apart in the context of source code.

Anonymous Pro also features an international, Unicode-based character
set, with support for most Western and European Latin-based languages,
Greek, and Cyrillic. It also includes special for those who need them.
