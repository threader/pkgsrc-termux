Comfortaa is a sans-serif font, comfortable in every aspect,
designed by Johan Aakerlund. The font, which includes three
weights (thin, regular and bold), is available on Johan's
deviantArt web page as TrueType files under the Open Font
License version 1.1. This package provides support for this
font in LaTeX, and includes both the TrueType fonts, and
conversions to Adobe Type 1 format.
