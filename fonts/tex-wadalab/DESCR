These are font bundles for the Japanese Wadalab fonts which work with
the CJK package. All subfonts now have glyph names compliant to the
Adobe Glyph List, making ToUnicode CMaps in PDF documents (created
automatically by dvipdfmx) work correctly. All font bundles now contain
virtual Unicode subfonts.
