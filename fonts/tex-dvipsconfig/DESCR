This is a collection of dvips PostScript header and dvips
config files. They control certain features of the printer,
including: A4, A3, usletter, simplex, duplex / long edge,
duplex / short edge, screen frequencies of images, black/white
invers, select transparency / paper for tektronix 550/560,
manual feeder, envelope feeder, and tray 1, 2 and 3, and
printing a PostScript grid underneath the page material--very
useful for measuring and eliminating paper feed errors!
