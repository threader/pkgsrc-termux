mf2pt1 facilitates producing PostScript Type 1 fonts from a
Metafont source file. It is not, as the name may imply, an
automatic converter of arbitrary Metafont fonts to Type 1
format. mf2pt1 imposes a number of restrictions on the Metafont
input. If these restrictions are met, mf2pt1 will produce valid
Type 1 output with more accurate control points than can be
reverse-engineered by TeXtrace, mftrace, and other programs
which convert bitmaps to outline fonts.
