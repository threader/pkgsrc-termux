In both lower and upper case 32 letters are defined (18 'plain'
ones, 5 long vowels and 9 aspirated consonants). The ligature
'agus' is also made available. The remaining characters
(digits, punctuation and accents) are inherited from the
Computer Modern family of fonts. The font definitions use code
from the sauter fonts, so those fonts have to be installed
before using eiad. OT1*.fd files are provided for use with
LaTeX.
