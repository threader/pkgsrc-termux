Clear Sans was designed by Daniel Ratighan at Monotype under
the direction of the User Experience team at Intel's Open
Source Technology Center. Clear Sans is available in three
weights (regular, medium, and bold) with corresponding italics,
plus light and thin upright (without italics). Clear Sans has
minimized, unambiguous characters and slightly narrow
proportions, making it ideal for UI design. Its strong,
recognizable forms avoid distracting ambiguity, making Clear
Sans comfortable for reading short UI labels and long passages
in both screen and print. The fonts are available in both
TrueType and Type 1 formats.
