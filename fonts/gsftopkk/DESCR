gsftopk is a program that uses Ghostscript to render PostScript fonts
(including mock-ups of the ``built-in'' 35; e.g., Times-Roman) and
convert the bitmaps to .pk format for use with xdvi or other .dvi
viewers.  Contrary to what its name may suggest, gsftopk can handle
all types of fonts acceptable to Ghostscript, including .pfa, .pfb,
and .ttf (TrueType) files.

gsftopkk is the same basic program, modified to work with Karl Berry's
Kpathsea path-searching library.
