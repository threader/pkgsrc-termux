The Cyclop typeface was designed in the 1920s at the workshop
of Warsaw type foundry "Odlewnia Czcionek J. Idzkowski i S-ka".
This sans serif typeface has a highly modulated stroke so it
has high typographic contrast. The vertical stems are much
heavier then horizontal ones. Most characters have thin
rectangles as additional counters giving the unique shape of
the characters. The lead types of Cyclop typeface were produced
in slanted variant at sizes 8-48 pt. It was heavily used for
heads in newspapers and accidents prints. Typesetters used
Cyclop in the inter-war period, during the occupation in the
underground press. The typeface was used until the beginnings
of the offset print and computer typesetting era. Nowadays it
is hard to find the metal types of this typeface.
