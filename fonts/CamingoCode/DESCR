CamingoCode is designed for source-code editors. It is based on
CamingoMono, but has several specially drawn glyphs that work well
at small sizes, including Q, l, &, *, ~ and #. The stroke weights
are relatively light, which makes CamingoCode suitable for both
bright and dark visual themes. The family consists of four style-linked
fonts (Regular, Italic, Bold and Bold Italic) and is manually hinted
to give the best possible appearance on screens.
