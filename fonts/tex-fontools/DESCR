This package provides a few tools to ease using fonts
(especially Truetype/Opentype ones) with Latex and fontinst:
afm2afm - reencode .afm files; designed to replace fontinst's
\reencodefont for big .afm files; autoinst - simplify the use
of the LCDF TypeTools by creating a command file for otftotfm,
plus .fd and .sty files; and ot2kpx - extract all kerning pairs
from an OpenType font.
