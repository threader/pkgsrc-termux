The package contains the Bera Type 1 fonts, and a zip archive containing
files to use the fonts with LaTeX. Bera is a set of three font families:
Bera Serif (a slab-serif Roman), Bera Sans (a Frutiger descendant), and
Bera Mono (monospaced/typewriter). Support for use in LaTeX is also
provided. The Bera family is a repackaging, for use with TeX, of the
Bitstream Vera family.
