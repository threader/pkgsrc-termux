To use freefonts with X11, you can manually perform the following steps:

1.  xset fp+ ${PREFIX}/share/fonts/X11/freefont
2.  xset fp rehash

Or configure your /etc/XF86Config by adding
${PREFIX}/share/fonts/X11/freefont to your FontPath.

A Fontmap file is available under ${PREFIX}/share/fonts/X11/freefont
for use with Ghostscript.

License files are also included for individual fonts. Read
${PREFIX}/share/fonts/X11/freefont/<font>.license to
find out more about a font.
