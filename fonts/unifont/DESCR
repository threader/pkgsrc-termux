GNU Unifont is an official GNU package.  It is a dual-width
(8x16/16x16) bitmap font, designed to provide coverage for all of
Unicode Plane 0, the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP).

GNU Unifont has a glyph for each visible code point in the Unicode
Basic Multilingual Plane (Plane 0) and some glyphs in the Supplemental
Multilingual Plane (Plane 1).  This version also includes many
glyphs in Michael Everson's ConScript Unicode Registry (CSUR).

Unifont only provides a single glyph for each character, making it
impossible to handle any language properly that needs context-dependent
character shaping. It is supplied in the form of a hex file, with
a converter to convert it to BDF. See http://czyborra.com/unifont/
or http://unifoundry.com/unifont.html for more information.  The
BDF font is converted to PCF, and the hex file is converted to a
TrueType font.
