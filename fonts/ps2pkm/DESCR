ps2pk is a tool that converts a PostScript type1 font into a
corresponding TeX PK font.  The tool is especially interesting if you
want to use fully hinted type1 fonts in your DVI previewer (instead of
the unhinted type1 fonts currently used in GhostScript) or on a
printer that has no PostScript interpreter.
