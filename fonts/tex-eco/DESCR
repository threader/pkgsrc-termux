A set of font metric files and virtual fonts for using the EC fonts with
oldstyle numerals. These files can only be used together with the
standard ec fonts. The style file eco.sty is sufficient to use the eco
fonts but if you intend to use other font families as well, e.g.,
PostScript fonts, try altfont.
