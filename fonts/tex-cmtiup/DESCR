The cmtiup fonts address a problem with the appearance of
punctuation in italic text in mathematical documents. To
achieve this, all punctuation characters are upright, and
kerning between letters and punctuation is adjusted to allow
for the italic correction. The fonts are implemented as a set
of vf files; a package for support in LaTeX 2e is provided.
