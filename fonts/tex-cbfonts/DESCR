This bundle presents the whole of Beccari's original Greek font
set, which use the 'Lispiakos' font shape derived from the
shape of the fonts used in printers' shops in Lispia. The fonts
are available both as Metafont source and in Adobe Type 1
format, and at the same wide set of design sizes as are such
font sets as the EC fonts.
