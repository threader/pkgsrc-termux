Gentium ("belonging to the nations" in Latin) is a Unicode typeface family
designed to enable the many diverse ethnic groups around the world who use the
Latin script to produce readable, high-quality publications. The design is
intended to be highly readable, reasonably compact, and visually attractive.
Gentium has won a "Certificate of Excellence in Typeface Design" in two major
international typeface design competitions: bukva:raz! (2001), TDC2003 (2003).

Gentium provides glyphs for a wide range of Latin and Greek characters. The
additional 'extended' Latin letters are designed to naturally harmonize with
the traditional 26 ones. Diacritics are treated with careful thought and
attention to their use. Gentium also supports both ancient and modern Greek,
including a number of alternate forms.

Gentium Regular also includes some Cyrillic glyphs, but they are only early
drafts. A future version will include a completely revised set, including
italic, and will expand the support for Latin, Greek and Cyrillic to Unicode
4.1.
