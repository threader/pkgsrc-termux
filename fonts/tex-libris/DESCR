LibrisADF is a sans-serif family designed to mimic Lydian. The
bundle includes: fonts, in Adobe Type 1, TrueType and OpenType
formats, and LaTeX support macros, for use with the Type 1
versions of the fonts. The LaTeX macros depend on the nfssext-
cfr bundle. GPL licensing applies the fonts themselves; the
support macros are distributed under LPPL licensing.
