A collection of fonts that reproduce those used in "old German"
printing and handwriting. The set comprises Gothic, Schwabacher
and Fraktur fonts, a pair of handwriting fonts, Sutterlin and
Schwell, and a font containing decorative initials. In
addition, there are two re-encoding packages for Haralambous's
fonts, providing T1, using virtual fonts, and OT1 and T1, using
Metafont.
