The fonts are converted from Metafont sources of the Computer
Modern font families, using textrace. Supported encodings are:
T1 (Latin), T2A (Cyrillic), LGR (Greek) and TS1. The package
also includes Unicode virtual fonts for use with Omega. The
font set is not a replacement for any of the other Computer
Modern-based font sets (for example, cm-super for Latin and
Cyrillic, or cbgreek for Greek), since it is available at a
single size only; it offers a compact set for 'general'
working. The fonts themselves are encoded to external
standards, and virtual fonts are provided for use with TeX.
