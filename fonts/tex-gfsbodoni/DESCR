Bodoni's Greek fonts in the 18th century broke, for the first
time, with the Byzantine cursive tradition of Greek fonts. GFS
Bodoni resurrects his work for general use. The font family
supports both Greek and Latin letters. LaTeX support of the
fonts is provided, offering OT1, T1 and LGR encodings. The
fonts themselves are provided in Adobe Type 1 and OpenType
formats.
