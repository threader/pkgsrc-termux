This is a Greek font written in Metafont, with inspiration from
the Bodoni typefaces in old books. It is stylistically a little
more exotic than the standard textbook Greek fonts,
particularly in glyphs like the lowercase rho and kappa. It
aims for a rather calligraphic feel, but seems to blend well
with Computer Modern. There is a ligature scheme which
automatically inserts the breathings required for ancient
texts, making the input text more readable than in some
schemes.
