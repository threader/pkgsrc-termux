Erewhon is based on the Heuristica package, which is based in
turn on Utopia. Erewhon adds a number of new features -- small
caps in all styles rather than just regular, added figure
styles (proportional, inferior, numerator, denominator) and
superior letters. The size is 6% smaller than Heuristica,
matching that of UtopiaStd.
