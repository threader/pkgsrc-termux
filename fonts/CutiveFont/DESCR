The design of Cutive, and this monospace sister family Cutive Mono,
is based on a number of classic typewriter typefaces, in particular
the faces of IBM's 'Executive,' and the older 'Smith-Premier.' In
Cutive these old faces re-emerge as webfonts that are useful for
adding character to body texts as well as in larger sizes for
headers and display.
