This bundle of tools comprises: Cfftot1, which translates a
Compact Font Format (CFF) font, or a PostScript-flavored
OpenType font, into PostScript Type 1 format. It correctly
handles subroutines and hints; Mmafm and mmpfb, which create
instances of multiple-master fonts (mmafm and mmpfb were
previously distributed in their own package, mminstance);
Otfinfo, which reports information about OpenType fonts, such
as the features they support and the contents of their 'size'
optical size features; Otftotfm, which creates TeX font metrics
and encodings that correspond to a PostScript-flavored OpenType
font. It will interpret glyph positionings, substitutions, and
ligatures as far as it is able. You can say which OpenType
features should be activated; T1dotlessj, creates a Type 1 font
whose only character is a dotless j matching the input font's
design; T1lint, which checks a Type 1 font for correctness;
T1reencode, which replaces a font's internal encoding with one
you specify; and T1testpage, which creates a PostScript proof
for a Type 1 font. It is preliminary software.
