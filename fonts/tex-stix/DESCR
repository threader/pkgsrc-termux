The STIX fonts are a suite of unicode OpenType fonts containing
a complete set of mathematical glyphs. The CTAN package is a
copy of the fonts' official release, organised as specified by
the TeX Directory Structure, for inclusion in standard TeX
distributions. A Type 1-only distribution of the fonts is
available in the esstix bundle.
