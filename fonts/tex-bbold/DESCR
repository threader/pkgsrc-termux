A geometric sans serif blackboard bold font, for use in
mathematics; MetaFont sources are provided, as well as macros
for use with LaTeX. The Sauter font package has MetaFont
parameter source files for building the fonts at more sizes
than you could reasonably imagine. See the blackboard sampler
for a feel for the font's appearance.
