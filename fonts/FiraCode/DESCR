Fira Code is a Fira Mono font extended with a set of ligatures for
common programming multi-character combinations. This is just a
font rendering feature: underlying code remains ASCII-compatible.
This helps to read and understand code faster. For some frequent
sequences like .. or // ligatures allow us to correct spacing.
