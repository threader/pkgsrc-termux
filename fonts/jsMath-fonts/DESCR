The jsMath package provides a method of including mathematics in
HTML pages that works across multiple browsers under Windows,
Macintosh OS X, Linux and other flavors of unix. It overcomes a
number of the shortcomings of the traditional method of using images
to represent mathematics: jsMath uses native fonts, so they resize
when you change the size of the text in your browser, they print
at the full resolution of your printer, and you don't have to wait
for dozens of images to be downloaded in order to see the mathematics
in a web page. There are also advantages for web-page authors, as
there is no need to preprocess your web pages to generate any
images, and the mathematics is entered in TeX form, so it is easy
to create and maintain your web pages.

Although it works best with the TeX fonts installed, jsMath will
fall back on a collection of image-based fonts (which can still be
scaled or printed at high resolution) or unicode fonts when the
TeX fonts are not available. This package contains the necessary
TeX fonts.
