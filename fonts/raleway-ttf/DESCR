Raleway is an elegant sans-serif typeface family.

Initially designed by Matt McInerney as a single thin weight, it
was expanded into a 9 weight family by Pablo Impallari and Rodrigo
Fuenzalida in 2012 and iKerned by Igino Marini. In 2013 the Italics
where added.

It is a display face and the download features both old style and
lining numerals, standard and discretionary ligatures, a pretty
complete set of diacritics, as well as a stylistic alternate inspired
by more geometric sans-serif typefaces than its neo-grotesque
inspired default character set.
