A family of sans serif fonts for TeX and LaTeX, based on Donald
Knuth's CM fonts. It comprises OT1, T1 and TS1 encoded text fonts
of various shapes as well as all the fonts necessary for mathematical
typesetting, including AMS symbols. This collection provides all
the necessary files for using the fonts with LaTeX.

A commercial-quality Adobe Type 1 version of these fonts is available
from Micropress. Free versions are available, in the cm-super font
bundle (the T1 and TS1 encoded part of the set), and in the hfbright
package (the OT1 encoded part, and the maths fonts).
