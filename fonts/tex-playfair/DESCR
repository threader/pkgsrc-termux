Playfair Display is well suited for titling and headlines. It
has an extra large x-height and short descenders. It can be set
with no leading if space is tight, for instance in news
headlines, or for stylistic effect in titles. Capitals are
extra short, and only very slightly heavier than the lowercase
characters. This helps achieve a more even typographical colour
when typesetting proper nouns and initialisms.
