This package provides access in (La)TeX to 20 high quality
icons of online academic profiles included in the free
"Academicons" font. It requires the fontspec package and either
the Xe(La)TeX or the Lua(La)TeX engine to load the included
academicons.ttf font. The "Academicons" font was designed by
James Walsh and released (see
http://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/) under the SIL Open Font
License. This package is inspired by and based on the
fontawesome package. academicons.sty provides the generic
\aiicon command to access icons, which takes as a mandatory
argument the name of the desired icon. It also provides
individual direct commands for each specific icon. The full
list of icons and their respective names and direct commands
can be found in the manual.
