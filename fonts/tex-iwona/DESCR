Iwona is a two-element sans-serif typeface. It was created as
an alternative version of the Kurier typeface, which was
designed in 1975 for a diploma in typeface design at the Warsaw
Academy of Fine Arts under the supervision of Roman
Tomaszewski. This distribution contains a significantly
extended set of characters covering the following modern
alphabets: latin (including Vietnamese), Cyrillic and Greek as
well as a number of additional symbols (including mathematical
symbols). The fonts are prepared in Type 1 and OpenType
formats. For use with TeX the following encoding files have
been prepared: T1 (ec), T2 (abc), and OT2--Cyrillic, T5
(Vietnamese), OT4, QX, texansi and nonstandard (IL2 for the
Czech fonts), as well as supporting macros and files defining
fonts for LaTeX.
