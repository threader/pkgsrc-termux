Lato is a sans-serif typeface family designed in the Summer 2010 by
Warsaw-based designer Lukasz Dziedzic ("Lato" means "Summer" in
Polish). In December 2010 the Lato family was published under the
open-source Open Font License by his foundry tyPoland, with support
from Google.

In 2013-2014, the family was greatly extended to cover 3000+ glyphs
per style. The Lato 2.010 family now supports 100+ Latin-based
languages, 50+ Cyrillic-based languages as well as Greek and IPA
phonetics. In the process, the metrics and kerning of the family
have been revised and four additional weights were created.
