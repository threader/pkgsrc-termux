This package augments the standard set normally distributed with TeX,
including extra mathematical symbols, blackboard bold letters
(uppercase only), fraktur letters, subscript sizes of bold math italic
and bold Greek letters, subscript sizes of large symbols such as sum
and product, added sizes of the Computer Modern small caps font,
cyrillic fonts (from the University of Washington), and Euler
mathematical fonts.  Adobe Type 1 versions of these fonts are also
available, and bitmap PK font versions are available via the fonts'
