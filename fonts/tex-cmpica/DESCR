An approximate equivalent of the Xerox Pica typeface; the font
is optimised for submitting fiction manuscripts to mainline
publishers. The font is a fixed-width one, rather less heavy
than Computer Modern typewriter. Emphasis for bold-face comes
from a wavy underline of each letter. The two fonts are
supplied as Metafont source.
