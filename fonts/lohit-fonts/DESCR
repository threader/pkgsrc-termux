In 2004, Red Hat has released five Indian language fonts as open source
licensed under the GPL.  The fonts were named "Lohit" which means "Red" in
Sanskrit.  Currently, the font family supports 11 Indian languages: Assamese,
Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Oriya, Punjabi, Tamil,
Telugu, and are available as TrueType fonts.  Now, Fedora Project and its
contributors took the responsibility to consolidate the further efforts and
improvements of the Lohit fonts.

The project goal is to improve existing offerings of the fonts - making sure
the Lohit fonts deliver the best available quality and functions to the
community.
