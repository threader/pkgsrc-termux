The cjhebrew package provides Adobe Type 1 fonts for Hebrew,
and LaTeX macros to support their use. Hebrew text can be
vocalised, and a few accents are also available. The package
makes it easy to include Hebrew text in other-language
documents. The package makes use of the e-TeX extensions to
TeX, so should be run using an "e-LaTeX".
