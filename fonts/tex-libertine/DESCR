The package provides the Libertine and Biolinum fonts in both
Type 1 and OTF styles, together with support macros for their
use. Monospaced and display fonts, and the "keyboard" set are
also included, in OTF style, only. The mweights package is used
to manage the selection of font weights. The package supersedes
both the libertineotf and the libertine-legacy packages.
