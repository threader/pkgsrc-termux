The font provides the Ogham alphabet, which is found on a
number of Irish and Pictish carvings dating from the 4th
century AD. The font is distributed as Metafont source, which
has been patched (with the author's permission) for stability
at different output device resolutions. (Thanks are due to
Peter Flynn and Dan Luecking.)
