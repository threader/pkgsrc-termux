The KIX code is a barcode-like format used by the Dutch PTT to
encode country codes, zip codes and street numbers in a
machine-readable format. If printed below the address line on
bulk mailings, a discount can be obtained. The font is
distributed in Metafont format, and covers the numbers and
upper-case letters.
