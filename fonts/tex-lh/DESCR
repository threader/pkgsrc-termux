The LH fonts address the problem of the wide variety of alphabets that
are written with Cyrillic-style characters.  The fonts are the
original basis of the set of T2* and X2 encodings that are now used
when LaTeX users need to write in Cyrillic languages.  Macro support
in standard LaTeX encodings is offered through the cyrillic and t2
bundles, and the package itself offers support for other (more
traditional) encodings.  The fonts, in the standard T2* and X2
encodings are available in Adobe Type 1 format, in the CM-Super family
of fonts.  The package also offers its own LaTeX support for OT2
encoded fonts, CM bright shaped fonts and Concrete shaped fonts.
