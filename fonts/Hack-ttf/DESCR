Hack is hand groomed and optically balanced to be a workhorse face
for code.

It has deep roots in the libre, open source typeface community and
expands upon the contributions of the Bitstream Vera & DejaVu
projects. The face has been re-designed with a larger glyph set,
modifications of the original glyph shapes (including distinct
point styles and semi-bold punctuation weight in the regular set
to make analphabetic characters less transparent), and meticulous
attention to metrics (including numerous spacing adjustments to
improve the rhythm of the face and the legibility of code at small
text sizes). The large x-height + wide aperture + low contrast
design combined with PostScript hinting/hint replacement programs
and a TrueType instruction set make it highly legible at commonly
used source code text sizes with a sweet spot that runs in the 8px
- 12px range on modern desktop and laptop monitors. Combine it with
an HD monitor and you can comfortably work at 6 or 7px sizes.
