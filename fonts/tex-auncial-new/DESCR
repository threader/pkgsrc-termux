The auncial-new bundle provides packages and fonts for a script
based on the Artificial Uncial manuscript book-hand used
between the 6th & 10th century AD. The script consists of
minuscules and digits, with some appropriate period punctuation
marks. Both normal and bold versions are provided, and the font
is distributed in Adobe Type 1 format. This is an experimental
new version of the auncial bundle, which is one of a series of
bookhand fonts. The font follows the B1 encoding developed for
bookhands. Access to the encoding is essential. The encoding
mainly follows the standard T1 encoding.
