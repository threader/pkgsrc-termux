A set of virtual fonts which emulates T1 coded fonts using the
standard CM fonts.  The package name, AE fonts, supposedly stands for
"Almost European".  The main use of the package was to produce PDF
files using Adobe Type 1 versions of the CM fonts instead of bitmapped
EC fonts.  Note that direct substitutes for the bitmapped fonts are
now available, via the CM-super, Latin Modern, and CM-LGC font sets.
