The well-known Euler fonts are suitable for typsetting
mathematics in conjunction with a variety of text fonts which
do not provide mathematical character sets of their own. Euler-
VM is a set of virtual mathematics fonts based on Euler and CM.
This approach has several advantages over immediately using the
real Euler fonts: Most noticeably, less TeX resources are
consumed, the quality of various math symbols is improved and a
usable \hslash symbol can be provided. The virtual fonts are
accompanied by a LaTeX package which makes them easy to use,
particularly in conjunction with Type1 PostScript text fonts.
They are compatible with amsmath. A package option allows the
fonts to be loaded at 95% of their nominal size, thus blending
better with certain text fonts, e.g., Minion.
