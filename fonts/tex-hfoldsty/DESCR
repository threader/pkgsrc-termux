The hfoldsty package provides virtual fonts for using oldstyle
(0123456789) figures with the European Computer Modern fonts.
It does a similar job as the eco package by Sebastian Kirsch
but includes a couple of improvements, i.e., better kerning
with guillemets, and support for character protruding using the
pdfcprot package.
