The font was generated from a MetaPost version of the sources
of the 'original' punk font. Knuth's original fonts generated
different shapes at random. This isn't actually possible in an
OpenType font; rather, the font contains several variants of
each glyph, and uses the OpenType randomize function to select
a variant for each invocation.
