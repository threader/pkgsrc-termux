These fonts were created in Metafont by Knuth, for his own
publications. At some stage, the letters 'P' and 'S' were
added, so that the MetaPost logo could also be expressed. The
fonts were originally issued (of course) as Metafont source;
they have since been autotraced and reissued in Adobe Type 1
format by Taco Hoekwater.
