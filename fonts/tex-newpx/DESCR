This package, initially based on pxfonts, provides many fixes
and enhancements to that package, and splits it in two parts
(newpxtext and newpxmath) which may be run independently of one
another. It provides scaling, improved metrics, and other
options. For proper operation, the packages require that the
packages newtxmath, pxfonts, and TeXGyrePagella be installed
and their map files enabled.
