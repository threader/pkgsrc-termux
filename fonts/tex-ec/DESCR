The EC fonts are European Computer Modern Fonts, supporting the
complete LaTeX T1 encoding defined at the 1990 TUG conference hold at
Cork/Ireland.  These fonts are intended to be stable with no changes
being made to the tfm files.  The set also contains a Text Companion
Symbol font, called tc, featuring many useful characters needed in
text typesetting, for example oldstyle digits, currency symbols
(including the newly created Euro symbol), the permille sign,
copyright, trade mark and servicemark as well as a copyleft sign, and
many others.  Recent releases of LaTeX2e support the EC fonts.  The EC
fonts supersede the preliminary version released as the DC fonts.  The
fonts are available in (traced) Adobe Type 1 format, as part of the
cm-super bundle.  The other Computer Modern-style T1-encoded Type 1
set, Latin Modern, is not actually a direct development of the EC set,
and differs from the EC in a number of particulars.
