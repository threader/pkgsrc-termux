The package provides a set of virtual fonts (built from the
standard Concrete fonts) providing a set of fonts that almost
cover the T1 encoding. The main characters missing, of those
specified in the T1 specification are eth, thorn, and the Sami
letter eng. Sometimes the PS (pound sterling) character is also
missing. For the typewriter fonts, the situation is worse.
