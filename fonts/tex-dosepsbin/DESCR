A Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) file may given in a special
binary format to support the inclusion of a thumbnail. This
file format, commonly known as DOS EPS format starts with a
binary header that contains the positions of the possible
sections: Postscript (PS); Windows Metafile Format (WMF); and
Tag Image File Format (TIFF). The PS section must be present
and either the WMF file or the TIFF file should be given. The
package provides a Perl program that will extract any of the
sections of such a file, in particular providing a 'text'-form
EPS file for use with (La)TeX.
