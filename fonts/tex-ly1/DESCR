The Y&Y 'texnansi' (TeX and ANSI, for Microsoft interpretations
of ANSI standards) encoding lives on, even after the decease of
the company; it is known in the LaTeX scheme of things as LY1
encoding. This bundle includes metrics and LaTeX macros to use
the basic three (Times, Helvetica and Courier) Adobe Type 1
fonts in LaTeX using LY1 encoding.
