This is a set of 23 tiny packages designed to make it easier to
use fonts from the initials package in LaTeX, e.g. with the
lettrine package. It is a response to comments on an answer at
TeX Stack Exchange (http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/236410/)
requesting sample package files for others to copy. I had
previously assumed these were too trivial to be of interest,
but if they would be useful, then I would prefer them to be
generally available via CTAN.
