The fonts were originally distributed as MetaFont sources only, but
Adobe Type 1 versions are also now available. Macro support is provided
for use under LaTeX; the package supports the "only" option (provided by
the somedefs package) to restrict what is loaded, for those who don't
need the whole font.
