The Obyknovennaya Novaya (Ordinary New Face) typeface was
widely used in the USSR for scientific and technical
publications, as well as textbooks. The fonts are encoded to
KOI8-R (which is a long-established Russian font encoding,
rather than a TeX/LaTeX encoding). To use the fonts, the user
needs Cyrillic font support.
