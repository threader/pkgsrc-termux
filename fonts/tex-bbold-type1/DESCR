The files offer an Adobe Type 1 format version of the 5pt, 7pt
and 10pt versions of the bbold fonts. The distribution also
includes a map file, for use when incorporating the fonts into
TeX documents, but no macro sets are provided (the fonts will
not provide the correct results using macros designed for use
with the MetaFont versions of the fonts. The fonts were
produced to be part of the TeX distribution from Y&Y; they were
generously donated to the TeX Users' Group when Y&Y closed its
doors as a business.
