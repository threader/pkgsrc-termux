CM-Super family of fonts are Adobe Type 1 fonts that replace the
T1/TS1-encoded Computer Modern (EC/TC), T1/TS1-encoded Concrete,
T1/TS1-encoded CM bright and LH fonts (thus supporting all European
languages except Greek, and all Cyrillic-based languages), and
bringing many ameliorations in typesetting quality.  The fonts exhibit
the same metrics as the MetaFont-encoded originals.
