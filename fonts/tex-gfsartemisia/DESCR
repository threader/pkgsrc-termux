GFS Artemisia is a relatively modern font, designed as a
'general purpose' font in the same sense as Times is nowadays
treated. The present version has been provided by the Greek
Font Society. The font supports the Greek and Latin alphabets.
LaTeX support is provided, using the OT1, T1 and LGR encodings.
