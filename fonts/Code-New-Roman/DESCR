Code New Roman is aimed for use in programming environments and
other circumstances where a monospaced font is specified. All
characters have the same width, like old typewriters, making it a
good choice for programmers. This font improved and target to Mac
OS Western New Roman, MONACO, Windows Consolas/Lusida Consolas,
ABeeZee and Bitstream Vera Sans Mono.This font display allowed a
design with proportions closer to normal text than traditional
monospaced fonts like Courier. This allows for more comfortably
reading of extended text on screen. OpenType features include
hanging or lining numerals; slashed, dotted and normal zeros; and
alternative shapes for a number of lower-case letters. The look of
text can be tuned to personal taste by varying the number of bars
and waves.
