MnSymbol is a symbol font family, designed to be used in
conjunction with Adobe Minion Pro (via the MinionPro package).
Almost all of LaTeX and AMS mathematical symbols are provided;
remaining coverage is available from the MinionPro font with
the MinionPro package. The fonts are available both as Metafont
source and as Adobe Type 1 format, and a comprehensive support
package is provided. While the fonts were designed to fit with
Minon Pro, the design should fit well with other renaissance or
baroque faces: indeed, it will probably work with most fonts
that are neither too wide nor too thin, for example Palatino or
Times; it is known to look good with Sabon. There is no package
designed to configure its use with any font other than Minion
Pro, but (for example) simply loading mnsymbol after mathpazo
will probably do what is needed.
