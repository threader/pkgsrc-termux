Provides fonts (both as Metafont source and in Adobe Type 1
format) based on the capitals carved on the Trajan column in
Rome in 114 AD, together with macros to access the fonts. Many
typographers think these rank first among the Roman's artistic
legacy. The font is uppercase letters together with some
punctuation and analphabetics; no lowercase or digits.
