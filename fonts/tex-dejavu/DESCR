The package contains LaTeX support for the DejaVu fonts, which
are derived from the Vera fonts but contain more characters and
styles. The fonts are included in the original TrueType format,
and in converted Type 1 format. The (currently) supported
encodings are: OT1, T1, IL2, TS1, T2*, X2, QX, and LGR. The
package doesn't (currently) support mathematics. More encodings
and/or features are expected.
