The fetamont typeface was designed in METAFONT and extends the
Logo fonts to complete the T1 encoding. The designs of the
glyphs A, E, F, M, N, O, P, S and T are based on the METAFONT
constructions by D. E. Knuth. The glyphs Y and 1 imitate the
shapes of the corresponding glyphs in the METATYPE1 logo.
