Junicode (short for Junius-Unicode) is a Unicode font for medievalists.
The current version is a beta; the selection of characters and the
arrangement of the Private Use Area are subject to change.

Junicode contains 3280 characters in the regular style (the italic,
bold and bold italic styles are less complete). These Unicode ranges
are either complete in the regular style or they contain substantial
numbers of glyphs (especially those of interest to medievalists).
