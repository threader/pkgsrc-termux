Inconsolata is a monospaced font designed by Raph Levien. This
package contains the font (in both Adobe Type 1 and OpenType
formats) in regular and bold weights, with additional glyphs
and options to control slashed zero, upright quotes and a
shapelier lower-case L, plus metric files for use with TeX, and
LaTeX font definition and other relevant files.
