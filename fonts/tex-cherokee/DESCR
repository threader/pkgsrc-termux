The Cherokee script was designed in 1821 by Segwoya. The
alphabet is essentially syllabic, only 6 characters (a e i o s
u) correspond to Roman letters: the font encodes these to the
corresponding roman letter. The remaining 79 characters have
been arbitrarily encoded in the range 38-122; the cherokee
package provides commands that map each such syllable to the
appropriate character; for example, Segwoya himself would be
represented \Cse\Cgwo\Cya. The font is distributed as Metafont
source; it works very poorly in modern environments, and could
do with expert attention (if you are interested, please contact
the CTAN team for details).
