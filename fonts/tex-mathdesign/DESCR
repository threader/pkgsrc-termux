The Math Design project offers free mathematical fonts, and "faked"
Caps-and-Small-Caps fonts, that fit with existing text fonts. So
far, four font families are available:

- the mdput family, which corresponds to Adobe Utopia text fonts
- the mdugm family, which corresponds to URW Garamond text fonts
- the mdfga family, which corresponds to the (commercial)
  Fontsite Garamond text fonts
- the mdbch family, which corresponds to Bitstream Charter text
  fonts

Each maths font has a range of extra symbols, and blackboard bold
and 'mathcal' alphabets.
