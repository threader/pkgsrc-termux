The MFizz font provides scalable vector icons representing
programming languages, operating systems, software engineering,
and technology. It can be seen as an extension to FontAwesome.
This package requires the fontspec package and either the
Xe(La)TeX or Lua(La)TeX engine to load the included ttf font.
