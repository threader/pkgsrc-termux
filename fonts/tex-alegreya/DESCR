The Alegreya fonts are designed by Juan Pablo del Peral for
Huerta Tipografica. Alegreya is a typeface originally intended
for literature. It conveys a dynamic and varied rhythm which
facilitates the reading of long texts. The italic has just as
much care and attention to detail in the design as the roman.
Bold, black, small caps and five number styles are available.
