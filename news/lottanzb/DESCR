LottaNZB aims to simplify and automate the download of binary news from the
Usenet, a world-wide internet discussion system. Users can tell LottaNZB what
to download using so-called NZB files, which are created by many Usenet search
engines. LottaNZB integrates nicely with GNOME desktops, but is not limited to
them and uses the mature HellaNZB software as its foundation.
