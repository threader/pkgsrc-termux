The FUSE-based pCacheFS file system provides a simple caching layer for
other filesystems.  This makes slow, remote filesystems seem very fast
to access.  Moreover, the cache does not disappear when you start or
stop pCacheFS or if you reboot your computer -- it is persistent.

pCacheFS is designed for caching large amounts of data on remote
filesystems that don't change very much, such as movie or music
libraries.
