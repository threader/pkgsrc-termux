Python bindings for the FUSE (and hence refuse) interfaces.

FUSE allows file sytsem operations to take place at user level, rather
than in the kernel.  Refuse is a BSD-licensed re-implementation of
fuse, running on top of the puffs functionality.  This package
provides a python language interface to the FUSE interface.

To achieve backwards compatibility (unlikely to be needed in 2011+)
with very old versions of the fuse bindings for python, set the
environment variable

	FUSE_PYTHON_COMPAT=0.1

This software is called "fuse-python" by upstream (and hence at least
some Linux distributions).
