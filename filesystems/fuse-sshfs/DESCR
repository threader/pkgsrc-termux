This is a filesystem client based on the SSH File Transfer Protocol.
Since most SSH servers already support this protocol it is very easy to
set up: i.e. on the server side there's nothing to do.  On the client
side mounting the filesystem is as easy as logging into the server with
ssh.

The idea of sshfs was taken from the SSHFS filesystem distributed with
LUFS.  There were some limitations in that codebase, and this
implementation features:

- Based on FUSE
- Multithreading
- Large reads (max 64k)
- Caching directory contents
- Reconnect on failure
