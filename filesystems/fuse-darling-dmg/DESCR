This project allows ordinary users to directly mount OS X disk images under
Linux via FUSE. darling-dmg is part of Darling - http://www.darlinghq.org

Without darling-dmg, the only way to do this would be to manually extract
the DMG file, become root and mount the HFS+ filesystem as root. This is slow,
wasteful and may even crash your system. The project's author has seen the
Linux HFS+ implementation cause kernel crashes.
