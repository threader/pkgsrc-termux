Module::Path provides a single function, module_path(), which will find
where a module is installed locally.

It works by looking in all the directories in @INC for an appropriately
named file:

    * Foo::Bar becomes Foo/Bar.pm, using the correct directory path
      separator for your operating system.
    * Iterate over @INC, ignoring any references (see "require" in
      "perlfunc" if you're surprised to hear that you might find references
      in @INC).
    * For each directory in @INC, append the partial path (Foo/Bar.pm),
      again using the correct directory path separator. If the resulting
      file exists, return this path.
    * If no file was found, return undef.
