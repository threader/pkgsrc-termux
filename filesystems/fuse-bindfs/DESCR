bindfs is a FUSE filesystem for mounting a directory to another location,
similar to 'mount --bind' in Linux or nullfs in BSD.  The permissions of
the mirrored directory can be altered in various ways.

Some things bindfs can be used for:
 - Making a directory read-only.
 - Making all executables non-executable.
 - Sharing a directory with a list of users (or groups).
 - Modifying permission bits using rules with chmod-like syntax.
 - Changing the permissions with which files are created.

Non-root users can use almost all features, but most interesting
use-cases need user_allow_other to be defined in /etc/fuse.conf
