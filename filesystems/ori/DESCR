Ori is a distributed file system built for offline operation and
empowers the user with control over synchronization operations and
conflict resolution. It provides history through light weight
snapshots and allows users to verify the history has not been
tampered with. Through the use of replication, instances can be
resilient and recover damaged data from other nodes.
