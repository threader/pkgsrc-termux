djmount is a UPnP AV client.  It mounts the media content of
compatible UPnP AV devices as a Unix filesystem.

Djmount automatically discovers all UPnP AV Media Servers on the
network, and makes the content available in a directory tree.  All
shared files (e.g.  Audio or Video files) are directly visible and can
be played using your favorite media player.
