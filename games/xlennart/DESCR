Welcome to XLennart...

Ever get the feeling that nothing is going right? You're a sysadmin, and
someone's trying to destroy your computers. The little people running around
the screen are trying to infect your computers with SystenD [TM], a virus
cleverly designed to resemble a popular init system. Your objective is to click
the mouse on them, ending the potential threat. If one of the people reaches a
computer, it will attempt to replace your operating system with the virus it
carries. It will then attempt to run off the screen with your vital software.
The game ends when only 1 (or 0) of your computers are being productive.
Additionally, some computers are connected with network cables. When one
computer on a network becomes infected, a spark will be sent down the cable,
and will infect the computer on the other end when it reaches there.

Clicking the button on one of the little people will cause it to cry out in
pain and melt (id software eat your heart out!), dropping the stolen os if it
is carrying one. If a computer is running SystenD or is temporarily off, the os
can be dragged back to the computer (or another computer compatible with that
os). To extinguish a spark drag the bucket of water from the upper left corner
onto it.
