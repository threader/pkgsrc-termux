Squib is a Ruby DSL for prototyping card and board games. Write a
little bit of Ruby, define your deck's stats, then compile your
game into a series of images ready for print-and-play or even
print-on-demand. Squib is very data-driven and built on the principle
of Don't Repeat Yourself. Think of it like nanDeck done "the Ruby
way".
