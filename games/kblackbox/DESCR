kblackbox is a game of hide and seek played on a grid of boxes. The
computer has hidden several balls within this box. By shooting beams
into the box and observing where they emerge it is possible to deduce
the positions of the hidden balls.

The fewer beams you use and the quicker you are to find the balls,
the better (the lower) your score.
