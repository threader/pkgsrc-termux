This package contains a collection of small computer programs which
implement one-player puzzle games. All of them run natively on Unix
(GTK), on Windows, and on Mac OS X; they can also be played on the
web, as Java applets.

Simon Tatham wrote this collection because he thought there should
be more small desktop toys available: little games you can pop up
in a window and play for two or three minutes while you take a
break from whatever else you were doing. And he was also annoyed
that every time he found a good game on (say) Unix, it wasn't
available the next time he was sitting at a Windows machine, or
vice versa; so he arranged that everything in my personal puzzle
collection will happily run on both those platforms and more. When
he finds (or perhaps invent) further puzzle games that he likes,
they'll be added to this collection and will immediately be available
on both platforms. And if anyone feels like writing any other front
ends - Mac OS pre-10, PocketPC, or whatever it might be - then all
the games in this framework will immediately become available on
another platform as well.
