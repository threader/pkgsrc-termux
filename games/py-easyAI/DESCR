EasyAI is a pure-Python artificial intelligence framework for
two-players abstract games such as Tic Tac Toe, Connect 4, Reversi,
etc.  It makes it easy to define the mechanisms of a game, and play
against the computer or solve the game.  Under the hood, the AI is
a Negamax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning and transposition
tables.
