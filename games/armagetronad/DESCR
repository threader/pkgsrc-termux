Armagetron Advanced is a multiplayer game in 3D that attempts to emulate
and expand on the light cycle sequence from the movie Tron.

Tron was an arcade game based on the movie of the same name, release by
Disney in 1982. The original game consisted of 4 sub-games, the only one of
concern is the 'Light Cycles' one, in which the player uses a left/right
joystick to control a 'Light Cycle' which leaves a wall behind it wherever
the cycle it goes, turning only at 90 degree angles. The player must then get
the AI to crash into their wall while avoiding hitting the AI's own wall
themselves. Those were the humble beginnings of Armagetron Advanced's
game play, which has now blossomed into 16 player mayhem, with highly
advanced AI, network game play, and of course all in a 3D environment.
