xsokoban is an implementation of the game sokoban, written on top of X(1).

The goal of xsokoban is to push all the round objects into  the score area
of each level using the mouse or the arrow keys. The arrow keys move the
player in the corresponding direction, pushing an object if it is in the way
and there  is a clear space on the other side. The mouse buttons each have a
distinct function.
