It is the year 2084. You control a secret organisation charged
with defending Earth from a brutal alien enemy. Build up your
bases, prepare your team, and dive head-first into the fast and
flowing turn-based combat.

UFO: ALIEN INVASION is a squad-based tactical strategy game in
the tradition of the old X-COM PC games, but with a twist. Our
game combines military realism with hard science-fiction and
the weirdness of an alien invasion. The carefully constructed
turn-based system gives you pin-point control of your squad while
maintaining a sense of pace and danger.
