Ur-Quan Masters is a port of the original Star Control 2 for 3DO Consoles.

The project started in August 2002, when Toys For Bob released the partially
ported sources of Star Control 2 3DO version to the fan community. Our goal
is to port this wonderful game to current personal computers and operating
systems. It is and will remain 100% free of charge, and anyone can contribute
to the project and thus help make it even better.
