kapman is a clone of the well known game Pac-Man. You must go through
the levels escaping ghosts in a maze. You lose a life when a ghost
eats you, but you can eat the ghosts for a few seconds when eating an
energizer. You win points when eating pills, energizers, and bonus,
and you win one life for each 10,000 points. When you have eaten all
the pills and energizers of a level, you go to the next level, and the
player and ghost speeds increase. The game ends when you have lost all
your lives.
