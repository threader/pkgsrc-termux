Cosmosmash - A space rock shooting video game.

In this game, you control a base that must destroy rocks before they hit the
ground, or you lose points. You must also prevent "spinners" from touching the
ground, or your base will explode.

This game is a clone of the 1981 Astrosmash game for the Intellivision by
Mattel Electronics.
