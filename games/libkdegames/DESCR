A collection of functions used by some games or which
are useful for other games.

Contents:
  kcarddialog: Access to carddeck selection and administration
               for cardgames
  kstdgameaction: just like kstdaction this provides some default
             action for kde games. games often use different entries
             than other apps (like "game" instead of "file"), so use
             this if possible
  kgamemisc: some static method i didn't know a good class name for. it
             currently features "randomName()" which will just give you
             a random name from a list
  kgame: this is a complete network/game handling library.
  kgamecanvas: a fast game-oriented canvas library
