Flare (Free Libre Action Roleplaying Engine) is a simple game engine built to
handle a very specific kind of game: single-player 2D action RPGs. Flare is not
a reimplementation of an existing game or engine. It is a tribute to and
exploration of the action RPG genre.

This package contains only the engine part of Flare.
