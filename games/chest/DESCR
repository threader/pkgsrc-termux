CHEST is an experimental program solving orthodox chess problems
(like "white to move and mate in 5 moves").  It is written in ANSI
C, and developed under UNIX.  There is no user interface:  CHEST
just reads an input file and produces plain text on standard output.

It is not hard to come up with a program that does the same job as
CHEST, but it will be rather slow for non-trivial jobs.  CHEST
tries hard to be fast but still 100% correct.
