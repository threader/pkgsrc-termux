klickety is an adaptation of the Clickomania game. The rules are
similar to those of the Same game: your goal is to clear the board
by clicking on groups to destroy them. The overall aim is to get the
lowest score possible. It will provide entertainment for all
abilities, but a challenge in logical thought if you want to get a
really low score.
