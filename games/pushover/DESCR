Pushover is a faithful reimplementation of the game with the same
name published in 1992 by Ocean. It contains the original levels;
the graphics and sound are very similar when compared with the
original game.

The task of the game is to rearrange the dominoes on the different
platforms so that you can start a chainreaction that makes all
dominoes topple over. You may rearrange all dominoes (except for
one kind of domino) and place them wherever suitable (except in
front of a door).
