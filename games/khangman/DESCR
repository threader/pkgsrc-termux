KHangMan is a game based on the well-known hangman game. It is aimed at
children aged six and over. The game has several categories of words to
play with, for example: Animals (animals words) and three difficulty
categories: Easy, Medium and Hard. A word is picked at random, the letters
are hidden, and you must guess the word by trying one letter after another.
Each time you guess a wrong letter, part of a picture of a hangman is drawn.
You must guess the word before being hanged! You have 10 tries.
