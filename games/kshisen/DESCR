kshisen is a solitaire-like game played using the standard set of
Mahjong tiles. Unlike Mahjong however, kshisen has only one layer
of scrambled tiles.  You can remove matching pieces if they can be
connected with a line with at most two bends in it. At the same
time, the line must not cross any other tiles.
