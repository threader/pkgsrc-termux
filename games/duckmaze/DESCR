duckmaze is a game about a duck that is in a maze. The duck can move walls,
but only if there are no walls in the way (it makes sense when you try it).

It's a simple puzzle game which starts with easy levels but progresses
to some quite tricky ones.

The game includes a full level editor, so feel free to create your own
and send them in!
