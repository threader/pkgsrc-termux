kiriki is an addictive and fun dice game for KDE, designed to be
played by as many as six players. Participants have to collect
points by rolling five dice for up to three times per single turn.
Each roll generates a specific combination of numbers which the
player is free to either accept or decline. However, each specific
combination of numbers can be accepted only once. After thirteen
turns the game ends and the scores are compared. The player with
the largest amount of points wins the game.
