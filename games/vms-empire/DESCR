VMS-Empire is a simulation of a full-scale war between two emperors, the
computer and you.  Naturally, there is only room for one, so the object of
the game is to destroy the other.  The computer plays by the same rules that
you do. This game was ancestral to all later expand/explore/exploit/exterminate
games, including Civilization and Master of Orion.
