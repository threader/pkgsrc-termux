wordwarvi, or "Word War vi", is an old school '80's style side
scrolling space shoot'em up video game.

You pilot your "vi-per" craft through core memory, trying to avoid
OS defenses and wipe out the memory hogging emacs processes and
rescue lost vi-per pilots (.swp files) stranded from crashed vi
sessions before heading through the socket to the next node in the
cluster to do it all over again.
