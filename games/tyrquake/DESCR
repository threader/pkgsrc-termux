TyrQuake is meant to be a fairly conservative branch of the Quake source
code.  It's intended to support Quake and Quakeworld in both software and
GL versions, as well as the Quakeworld Server.  It only contains bug fixes,
and does does not change the look or feel of the game by adding lots of
rendering enhancements, etc.
