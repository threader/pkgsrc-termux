granatier is a clone of the classic Bomberman game, inspired by the
work of the Clanbomber clone.
 
The object of the game is to run through an arena, using bombs to
clear out blocks and eliminate your opponents. Several bonuses and
handicaps are hidden underneath the blocks - these can either help
or hinder your progress.
