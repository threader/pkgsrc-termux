In this game you have to help a cute little green animal switch
off some kind of "evil" mechanism. The "power off switch" is hidden
somewhere in high towers. On your way to the target you need to
avoid a lot of strange robots that guard the tower.

That sounds all like a normal jump and run game. What makes this
game different is that you walk arond the tower which is revolving
on the screen, so that you only see the 180 degrees that are
currently visible.

The game is a reimplementation of the old game known as Tower
Toppler or Nebulus.
