Core War is a game in which two or more virus-like programs fight against
each other in a simulated memory space or core.

Core War programs are written in an assembly language called Redcode which is
interpreted by a Core War simulator or MARS (Memory Array Redcode Simulator).

The object of the game is to prevent the other program(s) from executing.
