Gnome Sudoku is based on the popular number-based logic puzzle in
which one must fill a 9 X 9 square with the correct digits. The
unique puzzles can be played on screen or printed to take along.
All games persist across sessions and you can resume any old game
at any time, as well as replay any game you've already won.
