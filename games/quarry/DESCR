Quarry is a multi-purpose GUI for several board games, at present
Go, Amazons, and Reversi (a.k.a. Othello.) It allows users to play
against computer players (third-party programs, e.g. GNU Go or
GRhino) or other humans, view and edit game records. Future versions
will also support Internet game servers and provide certain features
for developers of board game-playing engines for enhancing their
programs.
