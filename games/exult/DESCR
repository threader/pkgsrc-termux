As computers evolve, we risk losing classic games from the
not-so-distant past. One of these, Ultima 7, an RPG from the early
1990's, still has a huge following, and many consider it to be one of
the most immersive games ever produced.

Exult is a project to recreate Ultima 7 for modern operating systems,
using the game's original plot, data, and graphics files.  It enables
play of Ultima VII: The Black Gate and Ultima VII Part Two: Serpent
Isle, and their corresponding expansion disks Forge of Virtue and
Silver Seed, on modern machines.

In order to play these games, data files from the original games are
needed.
