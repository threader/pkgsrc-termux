OpenGFX, OpenMSX, and OpenSFX are an open source replacement for the original
Transport Tycoon Deluxe (TTD) graphics, music and base sounds used by OpenTTD.
The main goal therefore is to provide a set of free files which make it
possible to play OpenTTD without requiring the (copyright protected) files from
the TTD CD. This potentially increases the OpenTTD fanbase and makes it a true
free game (with "free" as in both "free beer" and "open source").
