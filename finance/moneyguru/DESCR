moneyGuru is a personal finance management application. With it,
you can evaluate your financial situation so you can make informed
(and thus better) decisions. Most finance applications have the
same goal, but moneyGuru's difference is in the way it achieves
it. Rather than having reports which you have to configure (or find
out which pre-configured report is the right one), your important
financial data (net worth, profit) is constantly up-to-date and
"in your face". This allows you to constantly make informed decision
rather than doing so periodically.
