This is a lightweight module to do currency conversion using the
Currency Converter web service at http://www.webservicex.net/.

The motivation for this module was many fold. First,
Finance::Currency::Convert with Finance::Quote was a little too
bulky for my needs, esp the need to download or maintain conversion
tables. Finance::Currency::Convert::Yahoo seemed to be based on
screen scraping. Way to fragile for my taste.
Finance::Currency::Convert::XE has usage restrictions from XE.com.
