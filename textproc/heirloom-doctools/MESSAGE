Running heirloom-doctools binaries
----------------------------------

Most of the binaries have the same name as their respective counterpart in
groff.  To avoid conflicts they have been installed to
${PREFIX}/heirloom-doctools/bin.  To use them you should add this directory
to your PATH variable (e.g. for sh and ksh):

	PATH=${PREFIX}/heirloom-doctools/bin:$PATH; export PATH

Reading heirloom-doctools manual pages
--------------------------------------

The manual pages are installed to ${PREFIX}/heirloom-doctools/man.  Since
groff does have manual pages with the same name adding this path to
man.conf(5) may not make sense.  Instead set (ksh example)

	MANPATH=${PREFIX}/heirloom-doctools/man:; export MANPATH

in the terminal where you want to read the manuals.
