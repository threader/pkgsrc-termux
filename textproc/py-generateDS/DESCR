generateDS.py generates Python data structures (for example, class
definitions) from an XML Schema document. These data structures represent
the elements in an XML document described by the XML Schema. In addition, a
separate file containing subclasses (stubs) is optionally generated. The user
can add methods to the subclasses in order to process the contents of an XML
document.
