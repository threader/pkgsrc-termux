This is a implementation of the JSON specification according to RFC
4627.  You can think of it as a low fat alternative to XML, if you
want to store data to disk or transmit it over a network rather than
use a verbose markup language.

The JSON generator escapes all non-ASCII an control characters with
\uXXXX escape sequences and supports UTF-16 surrogate pairs in order
to be able to generate the whole range of Unicode code points.  This
means that generated JSON text is encoded as UTF-8 (because ASCII is
a subset of UTF-8) and at the same time avoids decoding problems for
receiving endpoints that don't expect UTF-8 encoded texts.

This package is a pure Ruby variant that relies on the iconv and the
stringscan extensions, which are both part of the Ruby standard library.
