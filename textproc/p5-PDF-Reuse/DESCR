This module could be used when you want to mass produce similar (but not
identical) PDF documents and reuse templates, JavaScripts and some other
components. It is functional to be fast, and to give your programs capacity
to produce many pages per second and very big PDF documents if necessary.

The module produces PDF-1.4 files. Some features of PDF-1.5, like "object
streams" and "cross reference streams", are supported, but only at an
experimental level. More testing is needed. (If you get problems with a new
document from Acrobat 6 or higher, try to save it or recreate it as a PDF-1.4
document first, before using it together with this module.)
