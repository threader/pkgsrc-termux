This module implements utility functions for expanding embedded
variables in a string. Variable references are embedded in strings in
a similar form to the Bourne shell, namely, in the form $NAME or
${NAME}. In the former case, the NAME must consist of a capital letter
or underscore, and may be followed by zero or more capital letters,
digits or underscores. In the latter case, the name can consist of any
characters, but will be terminated by the first close brace character
'}'.

The string may also contain literal dollar marks, escaped by \$, and
literal escape marks, escaped by \\. These will be converted to $ and
\ respectively on return.

While there are many other modules that also provide expansion such as
this, this module provides the function expand_strings(), which will
perform variable expansions in all the values in a given hash, where
values can refer to other values within the same hash.
