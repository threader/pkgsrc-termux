This small module provides a way of formatting bibliographic references
using style templates similar to those used by the popular reference
management software Endnote (http://www.endnote.com/). The API is
embarrassingly simple: a formatter object is made using the class's
constructor, the new() method; format() may then be repeatedly called
on this object, using the same or different templates.
