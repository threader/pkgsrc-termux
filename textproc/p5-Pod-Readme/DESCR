This module is a subclass of Pod::PlainText which provides additional POD
markup for generating README files.
Why should one bother with this? One can simply use
  pod2text Module.pm > README
A problem with doing that is that the default pod2text converter will add text
to links, so that "L<Module>" is translated to "the Module manpage"...
