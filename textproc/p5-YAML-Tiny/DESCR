YAML::Tiny is a perl class for reading and writing YAML-style files,
written with as little code as possible, reducing load time and
memory overhead.

Most of the time it is accepted that Perl applications use a lot
of memory and modules. The ::Tiny family of modules is specifically
intended to provide an ultralight and zero-dependency alternative
to many more-thorough standard modules.

This module is primarily for reading human-written files (like
simple config files) and generating very simple human-readable
files. Note that I said human-readable and not geek-readable. The
sort of files that your average manager or secretary should be able
to look at and make sense of.

YAML::Tiny does not generate comments, it won't necesarily preserve
the order of your hashes, and it will normalise if reading in and
writing out again.

It only supports a very basic subset of the full YAML specification.
