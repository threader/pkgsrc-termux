TinyXML parses an XML document, and builds from that a Document Object Model
(DOM) that can be read, modified, and saved.

TinyXML uses a Document Object Model (DOM), meaning the XML data is parsed into
a C++ objects that can be browsed and manipulated, and then written to disk or
another output stream. You can also construct an XML document from scratch with
C++ objects and write this to disk or another output stream.

TinyXML doesn't parse or use DTDs (Document Type Definitions) or XSLs
(eXtensible Stylesheet Language.) There are other parsers out there (check out
www.sourceforge.org, search for XML) that are much more fully featured. But
they are also much bigger, take longer to set up in your project, have a higher
learning curve, and often have a more restrictive license. If you are working
with browsers or have more complete XML needs, TinyXML is not the parser for
you.
