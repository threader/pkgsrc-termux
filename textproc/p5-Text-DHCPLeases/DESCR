The Perl 5 module Text::DHCPLeases provides an object-oriented
interface to ISC DHCPD leases files. The goal is to objectify all
declarations, as defined by the ISC dhcpd package man pages.  This
interface is useful for analyzing, reporting, converting lease
files, or as a tool for other applications that need to import dhcpd
lease data structures.
