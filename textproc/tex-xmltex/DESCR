This package provides an implementation of a parser for documents
matching the XML 1.0 and XML Namespace Recommendations.  In addition
to parsing commands are provided to attatch TeX typesetting
instructions to the various markup elemenets as they are encounted.
Sample files for typesetting a subset of TEI, MathML, are included.
Element and Attribute names, as well as character data, may use any
characters allowed in XML, using UTF-8 or a suitable 8-bit encoding.
