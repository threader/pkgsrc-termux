Markup.ml is a pair of best-effort parsers implementing the HTML5 and XML
specifications.

In addition to being error-correcting, the parsers are:
* streaming: capable of parsing partial input and emitting signals while more
  input is still being received;
* lazy: not parsing input unless you have requested the next parsing signal,
  so you can easily stop parsing partway through a document;
* non-blocking: they can be used with Lwt, but still provide a straightforward
  synchronous interface for simple usage; and
* one-pass: memory consumption is limited since the parsers don't build up a
  document representation, nor buffer input beyond a small amount of
  lookahead.
