cssselect2 is a straightforward implementation of CSS3 Selectors
for ElementTree-compatible documents (including cElementTree, lxml,
etc.)  Unlike cssselect, it does not translate selectors to XPath
and therefore does not have all the correctness corner cases that
are hard or impossible to fix in cssselect.
