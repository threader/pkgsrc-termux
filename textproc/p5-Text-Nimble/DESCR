Nimble is a markup language that tries to make it easy to author
semantically-useful documents with special consideration given to
HTML5 output. Things like blog posts, wiki articles, and documentation
are meant to be easy to write using Nimble. Some parts of Nimble
syntax rely on aligning things using indentation, and so Nimble
likes to be written in a monospaced font. If you've ever used a
wiki markup language, you should feel right at home using Nimble.
