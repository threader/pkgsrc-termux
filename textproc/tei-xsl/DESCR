This is a set of XSLT specifications to transform TEI XML documents
to HTML, to LaTeX, and to XSL Formatting Objects.

It concentrates on TEI Lite, but adding support for other modules
is fairly easy. In the main, the setup has been used on new documents,
i.e. reports and web pages that have been authored from scratch,
rather than traditional TEI-encoded existing material.
