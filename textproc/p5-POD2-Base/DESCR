This module is an abstraction of the code in POD2::IT and POD2::FR. These
modules belong to the Italian and the French translation projects of core
Perl pods.

Once a translation package had been installed, the translated
documentation can be accessed with:

    $ perldoc POD2::<lang>::<podname>

(where <lang> is a language abbreviation like IT, FR, TLH, etc.)

To improve the support to read translated docs, the perldoc utility (since
version 3.14_01) was updated to find translated PODs via:

    $ perldoc -L IT <podpage>
    $ perldoc -L FR -f <function>
    $ perldoc -L TH -q <FAQregex>
