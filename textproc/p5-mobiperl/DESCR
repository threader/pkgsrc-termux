MobiPerl is a collection of tools for generating and manipulating
MobiPocket files written in Perl.

MobiPerl currently consists of the following Perl programs:

* html2mobi - Convert HTML file to a MobiPocket file.
* opf2mobi - Convert an opf file structure to a MobiPocket file.
* lit2mobi - Convert a lit file to a MobiPocket file.
* mobi2html - Explode a DRM free MobiPocket file.
* mobi2mobi - Manipulate meta data for a MobiPocket file.
* mobils - An "ls" program for MobiPocket files.

Since no official documentation for the MobiPocket is available
there might be some mistakes in the generation of the MobiPocket
files. It seems to work but there might be remaining bugs. So always
keep your original files so you can repeat the conversion if
necessary.
