This module applies the Porter Stemming Algorithm to its parameters,
returning the stemmed words.

The algorithm is implemented exactly (I hope :-) as described in:

    http://snowball.tartarus.org/algorithms/italian/stemmer.html

The code is carefully crafted to work in conjunction with the
Lingua::Stem module by Benjamin Franz, from which I've also borrowed
some functionalities (caching and exception list).
