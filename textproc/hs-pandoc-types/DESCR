Text.Pandoc.Definition defines the Pandoc data structure, which is used by
pandoc to represent structured documents. This module used to live in the
pandoc package, but starting with pandoc 1.7, it has been split off, so
that other packages can use it without drawing in all of pandoc's
dependencies, and pandoc itself can depend on packages (like citeproc-hs)
that use them.

Text.Pandoc.Builder provides functions for building up Pandoc structures
programmatically.

Text.Pandoc.Generic provides generic functions for manipulating Pandoc
documents.

Text.Pandoc.Walk provides faster, nongeneric functions for manipulating
Pandoc documents.

Text.Pandoc.JSON provides functions for serializing and deserializing a
Pandoc structure to and from JSON.
