Odfpy is a library to read and write OpenDocument v1.2 files. The main focus
has been to prevent the programmer from creating invalid documents. It has
checks that raise an exception if the programmer adds an invalid element, adds
an attribute unknown to the grammar, forgets to add a required attribute or
adds text to an element that doesn't allow it.

These checks and the API itself were generated from the RelaxNG schema, and
then hand-edited. Therefore the API is complete and can handle all ODF
constructions.
