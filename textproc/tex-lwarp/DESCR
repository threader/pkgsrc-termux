The package causes LaTeX to directly produce HTML5 output,
using external utility programs only for the final conversion
of text and images. Math may be represented by SVG files or
MathJax. Documents may be produced by LaTeX, LuaLaTeX, or
XeLaTeX. A texlua script removes the need for system utilities
such as make and gawk, and also supports xindy and latexmk.
Configuration is automatic at the first manual compile. Print
and HTML versions of each document may coexist, each with its
own set of auxiliary files. Support files are self-generated on
request. Assistance is provided for HTML import into EPUB
conversion software and word processors.
