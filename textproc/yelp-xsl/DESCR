yelp-xsl is a collection of programs and data files to help you build,
maintain, and distribute documentation. It provides XSLT stylesheets
that can be built upon for help viewers and publishing systems. These
stylesheets output JavaScript and CSS content, and reference images
provided by yelp-xsl. This package also redistributes copies of the
jQuery and jQuery.Syntax JavaScript libraries.
