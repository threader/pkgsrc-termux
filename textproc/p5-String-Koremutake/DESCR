The Perl 5 module String::Koremutake convert to/from Koremutake
Memorable Random Strings. The term "Memorable Random String" was
thought up by Sean B. Palmer as a name for those strings like
dopynl, glargen, glonknic, spoopwiddle, and kebble etc. that don't
have any conventional sense, but can be used as random identifiers,
especially in URIs to keep them persistent.
