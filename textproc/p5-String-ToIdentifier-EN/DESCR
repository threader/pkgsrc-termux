This module provides a utility method, "to_identifier" for converting
an arbitrary string into a readable representation using the ASCII
subset of "\w" for use as an identifier in a computer program. The
intent is to make unique identifier names from which the content of
the original string can be easily inferred by a human just by reading
the identifier.
