Many (professional) applications process XML messages based on a
formal specification, expressed in XML Schemas. XML::Compile
translates between XML and Perl with the help of such schemas. Your
Perl program only handles a tree of nested HASHes and ARRAYs, and
does not need to understand namespaces and other general XML and
schema nastiness.
