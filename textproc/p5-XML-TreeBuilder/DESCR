The Perl 5 module XML::TreeBuilder uses XML::Parser to make XML
document trees constructed of XML::Element objects (and XML::Element
is a subclass of HTML::Element adapted for XML). XML::TreeBuilder
is meant particularly for people who are used to the HTML::TreeBuilder
/ HTML::Element interface to document trees, and who don't want to
learn some other document interface.
