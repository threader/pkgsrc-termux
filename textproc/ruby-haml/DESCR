Haml (HTML Abstraction Markup Language) is a layer on top of XHTML or
XML that's designed to express the structure of XHTML or XML documents
in a non-repetitive, elegant, easy way, using indentation rather than
closing tags and allowing Ruby to be embedded with ease.  It was
originally envisioned as a plugin for Ruby on Rails, but it can
function as a stand-alone templating engine.
