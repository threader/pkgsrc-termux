Queequeg is a tiny English grammar checker for non-native speakers
who are not used to verb conjugation and number agreement. We
especially focus on people who're writing academic papers or business
documents where thorough checking is required. We aim to reduce
this laborious work with automated checking. Queequeg is named
after a character in Herman Melville's masterpiece.
