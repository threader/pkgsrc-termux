XML::TokeParser provides a procedural ("pull mode") interface to XML::Parser
in much the same way that Gisle Aas' HTML::TokeParser provides a procedural
interface to HTML::Parser. XML::TokeParser splits its XML input up into
"tokens," each corresponding to an XML::Parser event.

A token is a bless'd reference to an array whose first element is an
event-type string and whose last element is the literal text of the
XML input that generated the event, with intermediate elements varying
according to the event type.

Each token is an object of type XML::TokeParser::Token. Read
"XML::TokeParser::Token" to learn what methods are available for
inspecting the token, and retrieving data from it.
