Ruby-rison is a pure Ruby parser for Rison, a data serialization format
optimized for compactness in URIs.  Rison is a slight variation of JSON
that looks vastly superior after URI encoding.  Rison still expresses
exactly the same set of data structures as JSON, so data can be translated
back and forth without loss or guesswork.
