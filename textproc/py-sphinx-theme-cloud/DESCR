Sphinx is a tool that makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful
documentation for Python projects (or other documents consisting of multiple
reStructuredText sources), written by Georg Brandl. It was originally
created to translate the new Python documentation, but has now been cleaned
up in the hope that it will be useful to many other projects.

This package provides the cloud theme for Sphinx.
