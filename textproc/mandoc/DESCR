The mandoc manual page parser and formatter contains:
 * complete validating parsers for the mdoc and man languages
 * a slightly incomplete parser handling most of the tbl language
 * a very incomplete parser handling a part of the eqn language
 * support for a few selected roff requests that often occur in manuals
 * complete ASCII, UTF8, HTML and XHTML text output formatters
 * simple PostScript and PDF output formatters
 * output formatters producing indented mdoc and man parse trees

To format manuals for console display, it can be used as a smaller
and faster drop-in replacement for nroff -mandoc.  Some rare manuals
using lots of uncommon low-level roff requests may not work with
mandoc but require a full roff implementation.
