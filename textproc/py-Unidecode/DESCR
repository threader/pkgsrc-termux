It often happens that you have text data in Unicode, but you need
to represent it in ASCII. For example when integrating with legacy
code that doesn't support Unicode, or for ease of entry of non-Roman
names on a US keyboard, or when constructing ASCII machine identifiers
from human-readable Unicode strings that should still be somewhat
intelligeble (a popular example of this is when making an URL slug
from an article title).

Note that this module generally produces better results than simply
stripping accents from characters (which can be done in Python with
built-in functions). It is based on hand-tuned character mappings
that for example also contain ASCII approximations for symbols and
non-Latin alphabets.

This is a Python port of Text::Unidecode Perl module by Sean M.
Burke.
