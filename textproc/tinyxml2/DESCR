TinyXML-2 parses an XML document, and builds from that a Document
Object Model (DOM) that can be read, modified, and saved.

TinyXML-2 uses a Document Object Model (DOM), meaning the XML data is
parsed into a C++ objects that can be browsed and manipulated, and then
written to disk or another output stream. You can also construct an XML
document from scratch with C++ objects and write this to disk or another
output stream.

TinyXML (textproc/tinyxml) served the needs of the original author for
many years; but it uses memory inefficiently, and doesn't perform as
well as desired for mobile devices. The author wanted an XML parser that
was a little more modern, a little simpler (the "tiny" had been lost a
little over the years), and was a good fit for Android.

This led to TinyXML-2.
