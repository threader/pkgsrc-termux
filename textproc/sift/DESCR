RegEx - perl compatible regular expression syntax (no more escape
hell)

usable defaults - basic options known from grep but with usable
defaults

multiline support - find matches spanning over multiple lines
replace - replace output to reformat it to your needs without
relying on awk/sed

gzip files - search through normal and gzip'ed files in one program
call

multiple patterns - search for multiple patterns in one run
target selection - select or exclude search targets based on file
name, directory name, path and type

handling big data - sift handles big files without problems: files
>50GB, >5,000,000,000 lines and >5,000,000,000 matches successfully
