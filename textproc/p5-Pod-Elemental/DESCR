Pod::Elemental is a system for treating a Pod (plain old documentation)
documents as trees of elements. This model may be familiar from many other
document systems, especially the HTML DOM. Pod::Elemental's document object
model is much less sophisticated than the HTML DOM, but still makes a lot
of document transformations easy.

In general, you'll want to read in a Pod document and then perform a number
of prepackaged transformations on it. The most common of these will be the
Pod5 transformation, which assumes that the basic meaning of Pod commands
described in the Perl 5 documentation hold: =begin, =end, and =for commands
mark regions of the document, leading whitespace marks a verbatim paragraph,
and so on. The Pod5 transformer also eliminates the need to track elements
representing vertical whitespace.
