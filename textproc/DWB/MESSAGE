Running DWB binaries
--------------------

Most of the binaries have the same name as their respective counterpart in
groff.  To avoid conflicts they have been installed to ${PREFIX}/DWB/bin.
To use them you should add this directory to your PATH variable (e.g. for
sh or ksh):

	PATH=${PREFIX}/DWB/bin:$PATH; export PATH

It is also required to set the DWBHOME to ${PREFIX}/DWB:

	DWBHOME=${PREFIX}/DWB; export DWBHOME

Reading DWB manual pages
------------------------

The manual pages are installed to ${PREFIX}/DWB/man.  Most of DWB's
manual pages are not compatible with mandoc(1) or groff.  It is possible to
read them with e.g.

	tbl <path to file> | nroff -man | col -x | less
