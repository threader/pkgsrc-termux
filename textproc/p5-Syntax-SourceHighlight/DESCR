Source Highlight is a library to format code written in a number
of programming languages as text in a number of markup languages.

This binding to the underlying C++ library is very basic, supporting
only the essential functionality.

Note that any exceptions thrown by the underlying C++ library are
caught by the Perl binding and rethrown using the equivalent of a
die statement.
