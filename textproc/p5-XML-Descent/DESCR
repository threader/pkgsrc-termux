The conventional models for parsing XML are either DOM (a data structure
representing the entire document tree is created) or SAX (callbacks are
issued for each element in the XML).

XML grammar is recursive - so it's nice to be able to write recursive
parsers for it. XML::Descent allows such parsers to be created.
