SubLib is a library that eases the development of subtitling applications. It
supports the most common text-based subtitle formats and allows for subtitle
editing, conversion and synchronization.

SubLib is written in C# and can be used in platforms like Mono or .NET
Framework.

The library is currently used by the Gnome Subtitles project.
