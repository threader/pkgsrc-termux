XML::Elemental is a SAX-based package for easily parsing XML documents
into a more native and mostly object-oriented perl form.

The development of this package grew out of the desire for something
more object-oriented then XML::Simple and was more simplistic and
perlish then the various standard XML API modules such as XML::DOM.
Easier installation of modules was also a contributing factor.
