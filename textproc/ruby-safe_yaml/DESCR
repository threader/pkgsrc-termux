The SafeYAML gem provides an alternative implementation of `YAML.load`
suitable for accepting user input in Ruby applications.  Unlike Ruby's
built-in implementation of `YAML.load`, SafeYAML's version will not expose
apps to arbitrary code execution exploits (such as [the ones
discovered](http://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/167c11/serious_vulnerability_in_ruby_on_rails_allowing/)
[in Rails in early
2013](http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/Rails-developers-close-another-extremely-critical-flaw-1793511.html)).

If you encounter any issues with SafeYAML, check out the 'Common Issues'

experiencing, by all means,  [create an
