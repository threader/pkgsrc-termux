This is a sub-module to PDF::Reuse. It creates barcode "images" to be used in
PDF documents. It uses GD::Barcode and its sub-modules: GD::Barcode::Code39,
COOP2of5, EAN13 and so on, to calculate the barcode pattern. For Code128 it uses
Barcode::Code128.

Normally the barcodes are displayed on a white background and with the
characters under the bars. You can rotate the "image", make it smaller or
bigger, prolong the bars and change the background. (But then, don't forget to
test that your barcode scanner still understands it.)

If you don't change the size of the "image", the bars are approximately 24
pixels high (the guard bars a few pixels longer) and the box/background is 38
pixels high and something like 20 pixels wider than the barcodes. The text
under the bars are 10 pixels high.
