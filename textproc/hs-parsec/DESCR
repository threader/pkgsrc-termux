Parsec is designed from scratch as an industrial-strength parser library. It is
simple, safe, well documented (on the package homepage), has extensive
libraries, good error messages, and is fast. It is defined as a monad
transformer that can be stacked on arbitrary monads, and it is also parametric
in the input stream type.
