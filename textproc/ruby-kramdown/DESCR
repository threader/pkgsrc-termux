kramdown is yet-another-markdown-parser but fast, pure Ruby, using a strict
syntax definition and supporting several common extensions.

kramdown was originally licensed under the GPL until the 1.0.0
release. However, due to the many requests it is now released under the
MIT license and therefore can easily be used in commercial projects, too.
