Regexp::Copy can copy the contents of one Regexp object to another. Regexp
objects created with qr// are impossible to dereference. This causes problems
on changing the data within the Regexp objects without want to loose the
reference on it. Regexp::Copy allows to change the Regexp by copying one
object created through qr// to another.

The Regex::Copy distribution also loads Regexp::Storable, which provides
hooks to allow the Storable persistence method to freeze and thaw Regexp
objects created by qr//.
