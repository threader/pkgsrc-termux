The Link Grammar Parser is a syntactic parser of English, Russian,
Arabic and Persian (and other languages as well), based on Link
Grammar, an original theory of syntax and morphology.  Given a
sentence, the system assigns to it a syntactic structure, which
consists of a set of labelled links connecting pairs of words. The
parser also produces a "constituent" (HPSG style phrase tree)
representation of a sentence (showing noun phrases, verb phrases,
etc.).  The RelEx extension provides Stanford-style Dependency
Grammar output.
