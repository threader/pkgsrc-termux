Pagination is just limiting the number of records displayed.  Why should
you let it get in your way while developing, then?  This library makes
magic happen.  Did you ever want to be able to do just this on a model:

    @posts = Post.paginate :page => params[:page],
                           :order => 'created_at DESC'

and then render the page links with a single view helper?  Well, now
you can.

    <%= will_paginate @posts %>
