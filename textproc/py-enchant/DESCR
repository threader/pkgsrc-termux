PyEnchant is a set of language bindings and some wrapper classes
to make the excellent Enchant spellchecker available as a Python
module. The bindings are generated using SWIG. It includes all the
functionality of Enchant with the flexibility of Python and a nice
'Pythonic' object-oriented interface. It also aims to provide some
higher-level functionality than is available in the C API.

Enchant is the spellchecking package behind the AbiWord word
processor, is being considered for inclusion in the KDE office
suite, and has been proposed as a FreeDesktop.org standard. It aims
to provide a single API to access spellchecking services on any
platform, by wrapping the natively available spellchecking facilities.
For example, it can access aspell when running under Linux and
AppleSpell on Mac OSX.
