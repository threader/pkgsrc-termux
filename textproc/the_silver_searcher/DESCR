Why use ag?

* It searches through code about 3x-5x faster than ack.
* It ignores files matched by patterns in your .gitignore and .hgignore.
* If there are files in your source repo that you don't want to
  search, just add their patterns to a .agignore file.
* It's written in C instead of perl, the lesser of two evils :)
* The binary name is 33% shorter than ack!
