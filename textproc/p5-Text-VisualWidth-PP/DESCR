This module provides functions to treat half-width and full-width
characters and display correct size of text in one line on terminals and
mobile phones. You can know the visual width of any text and truncate text
by the visual width. Now this module support flagged UTF-8 and tested only
with Japanese.

This module is pure perl version of Text::VisualWidth. This is bit slow,
but it's not require compiler.
