The goal for this project is to provide translators to allow for
interoperability between applications based on ODF (OpenDocument)
1.0 standards and Microsoft OpenXML based Office applications. As
a part of this interoperability initiative, add-ins are being
developed that can be installed on top of Microsoft Office Word
(document processing), Excel (spreadsheet) and PowerPoint (presentation)
applications (Office 2007 / 2003 / XP version) to allow for opening
and saving OpenDocument format / ODF files (.odt, .ods and .odp)
that adheres to ODF 1.0 specifications. We also provide command
line translator utilities that allow doing batch conversions.

The converter is based on XSL transformations between two XML
formats, along with some pre- and post-processing to manage the
packaging (zip / unzip), schema incompatibility processings and
the integration into Microsoft Office applications like Word, Excel
and PowerPoint. We chose to use an Open Source development model
that allows developers from all around the world to participate &
contribute to the project.
