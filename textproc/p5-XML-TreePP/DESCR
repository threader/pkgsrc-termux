The Perl 5 module XML::TreePP module parses an XML document and
expands it for a hash tree. This generates an XML document from a
hash tree as the opposite way around. It is a pure Perl implementation.
It can also fetch and parse an XML document from remote web server
like JavaScript's XMLHttpRequest object.
