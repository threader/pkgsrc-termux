csvkit is a suite of utilities for converting to and working with CSV,
the king of tabular file formats.

csvkit is to tabular data what the standard Unix text processing suite
(grep, sed, cut, sort) is to text. As such, csvkit adheres to the Unix
philosophy.

    Small is beautiful.
    Make each program do one thing well.
    Build a prototype as soon as possible.
    Choose portability over efficiency.
    Store data in flat text files.
    Use software leverage to your advantage.
    Use shell scripts to increase leverage and portability.
    Avoid captive user interfaces.
    Make every program a filter.
