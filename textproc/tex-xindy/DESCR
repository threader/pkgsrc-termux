Xindy was developed after an impasse had been encountered in
the attempt to complete internationalisation of makeindex.
Xindy can be used to process indexes for documents marked up
using (La)TeX, Nroff family and SGML-based languages. Xindy is
highly configurable, both in markup terms and in terms of the
collating order of the text being processed.
