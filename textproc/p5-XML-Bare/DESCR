This module is a 'Bare' XML parser. It is implemented in C. The parser itself
is a simple state engine that is less than 500 lines of C. The parser builds
a C struct tree from input text. That C struct tree is converted to a Perl
hash by a Perl function that makes basic calls back to the C to go through
the nodes sequentially.
