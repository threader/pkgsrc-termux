Temple is an abstraction and a framework for compiling templates to pure Ruby.
It's all about making it easier to experiment, implement and optimize template
languages.  If you're interested in implementing your own template language,
or anything else related to the internals of a template engine: You've come to
the right place.

Have a look around, and if you're still wondering: Ask on the mailing list and
we'll try to do our best.  In fact, it doesn't have to be related to Temple at
all.  As long as it has something to do with template languages, we're
interested: <http://groups.google.com/group/guardians-of-the-temple>.
