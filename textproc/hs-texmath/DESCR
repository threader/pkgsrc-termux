The texmath library provides functions to read and write TeX math,
presentation MathML, and OMML (Office Math Markup Language, used in
Microsoft Office). Support is also included for converting math formats to
pandoc's native format (allowing conversion, via pandoc, to a variety of
different markup formats). The TeX reader supports basic LaTeX and AMS
extensions, and it can parse and apply LaTeX macros.
(See http://johnmacfarlane.net/texmath for a live demo of
 bidirectional conversion between LaTeX and MathML.)

The package also includes several utility modules which may be useful for
anyone looking to manipulate either TeX math or MathML. For example, a copy
of the MathML operator dictionary is included.
