Xfce 4 Modem Lights panel plugin is intended to simplify establishing a ppp
connection via a modem. It is primarily designed to work with the debian ppp
package and the pon/poff scripts provided by that package, but should be usable
with any scripts that create a lock file during dialing and retain it through
the connection.
