Gammu is a command line utility and library to work with mobile phones
from many vendors. Support for different models differs, but basic
functions should work with majority of them. The program can work with
contacts, messages (SMS, EMS and MMS), calendar, todos, file system,
integrated radio, camera, etc. It also supports a daemon mode to send
and receive SMS messages.

Gammu includes Python bindings, which allows easy scripting of
desired functionality using core functions.
