HIDAPI is a multi-platform library which allows an application to interface
with USB and Bluetooth HID-Class devices on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.
On Windows, a DLL is built.  On other platforms (and optionally on Windows),
the single source file can simply be dropped into a target application.

HIDAPI has four back-ends:
	* Windows (using hid.dll)
	* Linux/hidraw (using the Kernel's hidraw driver)
	* Linux/libusb (using libusb-1.0)
	* Mac (using IOHidManager)

This package includes only the libusb backend.
