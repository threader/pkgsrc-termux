RXTX is a Java library, using a native implementation (via JNI), providing
serial and parallel communication for the Java Development Toolkit (JDK).

It is based on the specification for Sun's Java Communications API, though
while many of the class descriptions are the same the package used it not,
since gnu.io is used instead. A certain amount of compatibility is intended
with API, though this project should be considered as a fork and therefore
compatible in spirit, but not in implementation.
