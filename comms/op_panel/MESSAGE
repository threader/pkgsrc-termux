You will need to make Flash Operator Panel accessible through your
HTTP server.  If you are running Apache, then you may either symlink

	${SMDIR}

into DocumentRoot, or add the following line to httpd.conf:

	Include ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/${FOP}.conf

Please see the instructions at http://www.asternic.org/documentation.html
for instructions on how to setup the Flash Operator Panel.
