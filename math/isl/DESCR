isl is a library for manipulating sets and relations of integer
points bounded by linear constraints. Supported operations on sets
include intersection, union, set difference, emptiness check, convex
hull, (integer) affine hull, integer projection, and computing the
lexicographic minimum using parametric integer programming. It also
includes an ILP solver based on generalized basis reduction.
