TinySVM is an implementation of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) [Vapnik 95],
[Vapnik 98] for the problem of pattern recognition. Support Vector Machines is a
new generation learning algorithms based on recent advances in statistical
learning theory, and applied to large number of real-world applications, such as
text categorization, hand-written character recognition.
