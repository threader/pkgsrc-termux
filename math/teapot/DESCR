teapot is a spread sheet program for UNIX, which uses modern concepts
besides being portable and extensible, for instance three dimensional
tables and iterative expressions.

The most important feature is the funktional addressing of cells,
unlike the traditional approach like A0, C5, etc. which is probably
inherited from VisiCalc.
