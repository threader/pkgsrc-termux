Qalculate! is a modern multi-purpose desktop calculator.
It is small and simple to use but with much power and versatility underneath.
Features include customizable functions, units, arbitrary precision, plotting,
and a graphical interface that uses a one-line fault-tolerant expression
entry (although it supports optional traditional buttons).
This is the GNOME version.
