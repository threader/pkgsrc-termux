A package with classes and methods for spatio-temporal data.  In
particular, space-time regular lattices, sparse lattices, and
irregular data are supported, with limited support for trajectories,
but not for topologies with S/T interactions such as space-time
prisms.  Utility functions are provided for plotting data as map
sequences (lattice or animation) or multiple time series; for spatial
and temporal selection, as well as methods for retrieving coordinates,
for subsetting, print, summary, etc.
