Pure Perl implementation of the Mersenne Twister algorithm as
implemented in C/XS in Math::Random::MT. The output is identical
to the C/XS version. The Mersenne Twister is a 32 bit pseudorandom
number generator developed by Makoto Matsumoto and Takuji Nishimura.
The algorithm is characterised by a very uniform distribution but
is not cryptographically secure. What this means in real terms is
that it is fine for modeling but no good for crypto.
