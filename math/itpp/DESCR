C++ library of mathematical, signal processing and communication
routines

Its main use is in simulation of communication systems and for
performing research in the area of communications.  The kernel of the
library consists of generic vector and matrix classes, and a set of
accompanying routines.  Such a kernel makes IT++ similar to MATLAB or
GNU Octave.
