Fits models for genotypic disequilibria, as described in Huttley and
Wilson (2000), Weir (1996) and Weir and Wilson (1986).  Contrast terms
are available that account for first order interactions between loci.
Also implements, for a single locus in a single population, a
conditional exact test for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium
