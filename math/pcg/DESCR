The PCG family of Random Number Generators combines properties not
previously seen together in the same generation scheme:

+ It's really easy to use, and yet its very flexible and offers
powerful features (including some that allow you to perform silly
party tricks).

+ It's very fast, and can occupy very little space.

+ It has small code size.

+ It's performance in statistical tests is excellent (see the PCG
paper for full details).

+ It's much less predictable and thus more secure than most generators.

+ It's open source software, with a permissive license (the Apache license).
