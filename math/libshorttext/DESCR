LibShortText is an open source tool for short-text classification and
analysis. It can handle the classification of, for example, titles,
questions, sentences, and short messages. Main features of
LibShortText include
  * It is more efficient than general text-mining packages. On a
    typical computer, processing and training 10 million short texts
    takes only around half an hour.
  * The fast training and testing is built upon the linear classifier LIBLINEAR
  * Default options often work well without tedious tuning.
  * An interactive tool for error analysis is included. Based on the
    property that each short text contains few words, LibShortText
    provides details in predicting each text.
