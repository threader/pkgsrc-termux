aamath is a program that reads mathematical expressions in infix
notation and renders them as ASCII art. It may be useful to send
mathematics through text-only media, such as e-mail or newsgroups.

As a simple example, the output for an expression such as

     	    A_OPR = x*sqrt(x^2-1)/2 - int(sqrt(t^2-1), t = 1 .. x)

will look like

                        x
            ______     /
           / 2        |    ______
       x \/ x  - 1    |   / 2
A    = ----------- -  | \/ t  - 1 dt
 OPR        2         |
                      |
                     /
                      1

Other than the usual operations (addition, subtraction,
multiplication, division, and exponentiation), aamath can also handle
functions, integrals, limits, sums, products, matrices and
vectors.
