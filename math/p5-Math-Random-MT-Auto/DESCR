This module provides pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) that are
based on the Mersenne Twister algorithm.  There is a functional
interface to a standalone PRNG, and an OO interface (based on the
inside-out object model as implemented by the Object::InsideOut
module) for generating multiple PRNG objects.
