This module implements the same interface as Math::Random::ISAAC and can
be used as a drop-in replacement. This is the recommended implementation
of the module, based on Bob Jenkins' reference implementation in C.

Selecting the backend to use manually really only has two uses:

    * If you are trying to avoid the small overhead incurred with
      dispatching method calls to the appropriate backend modules.
    * If you are testing the module for performance and wish to
      explicitly decide which module you would like to use.
