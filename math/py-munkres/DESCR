The Munkres module provides an implementation of the Munkres
algorithm (also called the Hungarian algorithm or the Kuhn-Munkres
algorithm), useful for solving the Assignment Problem.

Assignment Problem: Let C be an nxn matrix representing the costs
of each of n workers to perform any of n jobs. The assignment
problem is to assign jobs to workers in a way that minimizes the
total cost. Since each worker can perform only one job and each
job can be assigned to only one worker the assignments represent
an independent set of the matrix C.
