TrustedQSL is a LoTW (Logbook of The World) application to upload
QSO's (contacts) information onto Logbook servers maintained by the
ARRL (American Radio Relay League).

Logbook of The World - LoTW  - is an exciting way for Radio Amateurs
to confirm two-way contacts they have made and use the confirmations
as credit toward various awards.

Because Logbook of The World uses double blind comparison, users
cannot see what other users have uploaded unless there is a matched
QSO.
