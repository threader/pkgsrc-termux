FreeDV is a GUI application for Windows and Linux (MacOS and BSD are
in testing) that allows any SSB radio to be used for low bit rate
digital voice.

Speech is compressed down to 1400 bit/s then modulated onto a 1100 Hz
wide QPSK signal which is sent to the Mic input of a SSB radio. On
receive, the signal is received by the SSB radio, then demodulated and
decoded by FreeDV.

FreeDV was built by an international team of Radio Amateurs working
together on coding, design, user interface and testing. FreeDV is open
source software, released under the GNU Public License version
2.1. The FDMDV modem and Codec 2 Speech codec used in FreeDV are also
open source.
