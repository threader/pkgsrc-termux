GNU Radio is a collection of software that when combined with minimal hardware,
allows the construction of radios where the actual waveforms transmitted and
received are defined by software. What this means is that it turns the digital
modulation schemes used in today's high performance wireless devices into
software problems.

ControlPort is a new set of hooks into GNU Radio to allow a remote client to
attach to a running GNU Radio program and get and set parameters. It's quite a
powerful concept with an SDR application, and we think that there are tons of
ways to use this to improve on current work and to think of entirely new ways
of using SDR.
