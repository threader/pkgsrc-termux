While primarily being developed for the OsmoSDR hardware, this block
as well supports:

 * FUNcube Dongle through libgnuradio-fcd
 * FUNcube Dongle Pro+ through gr-fcdproplus
 * sysmocom OsmoSDR Devices through libosmosdr
 * RTL2832U based DVB-T dongles through librtlsdr
 * RTL-TCP spectrum server (see librtlsdr project)
 * MSi2500 based DVB-T dongles through libmirisdr
 * gnuradio .cfile input through libgnuradio-blocks
 * RFSPACE SDR-IQ, SDR-IP, NetSDR (incl. X2 option)
 * AirSpy Wideband Receiver through libairspy
 * Great Scott Gadgets HackRF through libhackrf
 * Nuand LLC bladeRF through libbladeRF library
 * Ettus USRP Devices through Ettus UHD library

By using the OsmoSDR block you can take advantage of a common software api in
your application(s) independent of the underlying radio hardware.
