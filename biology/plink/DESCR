PLINK is a free, open-source whole genome association analysis
toolset, designed to perform a range of basic, large-scale
analyses in a computationally efficient manner.

The focus of PLINK is purely on analysis of genotype/phenotype
data, so there is no support for steps prior to this (e.g. study
design and planning, generating genotype or CNV calls from raw
data). Through integration with gPLINK and Haploview, there is
some support for the subsequent visualization, annotation and
storage of results.
