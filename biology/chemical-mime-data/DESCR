The chemical-mime-data package is a collection of data files to add support
for various chemical MIME types on Linux/UNIX desktops, such as KDE and GNOME.

Chemical MIMEs were proposed in 1995, though it seems they have never been
registered with IANA. But they are widely used and the project's aim is, to
support these important, but unofficial MIME types.
