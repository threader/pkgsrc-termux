COPYING, PAYMENT AND SUCH DETAILS

I wrote this program because I needed it. After I released the first
version, I got the feeling that other people may need it too.

You may copy it and modify it in any way you like, the only thing that
can make me mad is if you sell it for real money and do not give me some.

As usual, there is no guarantee about anything at all, and you are not able
to claim that I have done any damage to you by providing you with this
program; any use you make of it is entirely at your own risk.

If you like it, you are free to send me the price of a large pizza
(my favourite costs around NOK 120 / USD 20 around Trondheim).
Or not, if you don't feel like it.
(See the file CONTRIBUTIONS for details)
