How to license NNTPCACHE for your commercial / government / site
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	0. If you are upgrading from an old nntpcache license then the
           upgrade fee is n/3, where n is the number of years since
	   your last license. So during the first year
	   upgrades are free, during the second year 1/3 the cost, etc.

	1. Work out how many users your site has. You will probably
	   want to artificially increase this number if you expect
	   it to grow in the future so you don't unintentionally
	   break the license conditions. This figure is the actual
	   number of users site-wide (e.g wc /etc/passwd or ypcat
	   passwd|wc), NOT the number of concurrent NNTPCache users.

	   Don't worry, it is presumed that only a minority of
	   network users use news regularly. The figures reflect
	   this expectation. What we're trying to work out is the
	   approximate size of the network user base.

	   We calculate the license size in this fashion because
	   other models would dramatically increase compliance costs
	   or prevent interesting network topologies.
           Organisations usually know (or can easily work out),
	   the number of network users they have, but introducing
	   a user accounting system for just for news would be
	   be odious as would limiting the number or configuration
	   of servers.

	   You can run as many NNTPCache machines as you want. In
	   *any* network configuration you want. If NNTPCache was
	   licensed on a per-machine or concurrent user basis, then
	   this would be impossible.

	2. Choose the appropriate site license for your site:

	        TYPE			$US		$AUS*

		Single user		$10		$15
		Under 10    users	$50		$70
		Under 100   users	$120		$190
		Under 500   users	$300		$450
		Under 1000  users	$500		$750
		Under 5000  users	$1500		$2272
		Under 10000 users	$3000		$4545
		Over  10000 users	negotiable+	negotiable+

* Note than you can only pay in Australian dollars if your organisation
  is headquartered in Australia or New-Zealand.

+ If no fee is mutally negotiated, then the fee shall be $3000 USD per
  ten thousand users.

	3. Make your payment as follows:
	
		i) Fill out the following and send it off (see iii)

License type		____________________	(see above)
Cost of license		________		(In dollars)
Payment type		_____________________   (cheque drawn on an Australian
						bank, international money order, EFT

Currency		___			($US or $AUS)
Email address		___________________	(e.g currierbell@isp.com)

		ii)	Make the transaction payable to:

			a) In the case of a cheque / money order:

				Australian National Cognitive Facility

			   WE WILL NOT ACCEPT INTERNATIONAL CHEQUES, UNLESS 
	                   SPECIFICALLY NEGOTIATED. We'd like to be able
			   to accept international cheques but the
			   banking fees and paperwork are unbelievable.

			b) In the case of an Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT):

				Please tell us what part of the world you are
				in and the name of your bank and we will provide
				you with an appropriate SWIFT/BSB number. This
				is usually the least painful method if you have
				access to a modern banking system.

			   order, land/air mail to:

				Australian National Cognitive Facility
