Teapot is copyright (c) by Michael Haardt, 1995, 1996, 1997, 2001.  

The implementation of clocked expressions is modelled after the
description of clocked evaluation in the PhD work of Jörg Wittenberger
<joerg.wittenberger@inf.tu-dresden.de> at the University of Technology
in Dresden, Germany.  The German message catalog was contributed by
Guido Müsch, the Dutch catalog by Wim van Dorst
<baron@clifton.hobby.nl> and the Ukrainian catalog by Volodymyr
M. Lisivka <lvm@mystery.lviv.net>.  The trigonometric functions were
inspired by Koniorczyk Mátyás <kmatyas@cs.elte.hu>.  The context
output format was contributed by Marko Schuetz <MarkoSchuetz@web.de>.

it or derived works, alone or as part of a bigger product, needs a
