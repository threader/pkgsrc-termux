Scheme 48 is an implementation of the Scheme programming language as
described in the Revised^5 Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme.
It is based on a compiler and interpreter for a virtual Scheme
machine.  The name derives from our desire to have an implementation
that is simple and lucid enough that it looks as if it were written in
just 48 hours.  We don't claim to have reached that stage yet; much
more simplification is necessary.

Scheme 48 tries to be faithful to Revised^5 Scheme Report, providing
neither more nor less in the initial user environment. (This is not to
say that more isn't available in other environments.)
