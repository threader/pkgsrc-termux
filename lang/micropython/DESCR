This is the MicroPython project, which aims to put an implementation
of Python 3.x on microcontrollers and small embedded systems.

WARNING:  this project is in beta stage and is subject to changes of
the code-base, including project-wide name changes and API changes.

MicroPython implements the entire Python 3.4 syntax (including
exceptions, "with", "yield from", etc.).  The following core datatypes
are provided:  str (including basic Unicode support), bytes,
bytearray, tuple, list, dict, set, frozenset, array.array,
collections.namedtuple, classes and instances.  Builtin modules
include sys, time, and struct.  Note that only subset of Python 3.4
functionality is implemented for the data types and modules.

Documentation is at <http://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/>.
