OSSP js is a stand-alone distribution of the JavaScript (JS)
programming language reference implementation from Mozilla -- aka
"JSRef" or "SpiderMonkey". This distribution provides a smart,
stand-alone and portable distribution of Mozilla JavaScript through a
GNU autotools-based build environment.  Additionally,
the C API in "libjs" contains both the JavaScript engine and the
required Sun math library ("fdlibm") and with all internal symbols
carefully protected under the "js" namespace. Finally, a js-config(1)
utility and a pkg-config(1) specification is provided to allow
applications to easily build with the JavaScript C API.

OSSP js was created because for OSSP and similar pedantic C coding
projects a smart, stand-alone, portable, clean, powerful and
robust scripting language engine is required. JavaScript is a
great programming language and Mozilla JavaScript "SpiderMonkey"
definitely is an acceptable clean, powerful and robust implementation.
Unfortunately there is just a stand-alone distribution released from
time to time by Mozilla and it is far away from really being smart,
stand-alone and portable. OSSP js combines the best from two worlds:
the 1:1 repackaged JavaScript code base from Mozilla with the GNU
autotools-based build environment as always used by OSSP.  Additionally,
this package provides stdio-based file object support and does not depend
upon the Mozilla NSPR library.
