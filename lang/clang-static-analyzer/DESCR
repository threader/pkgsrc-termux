The Clang Static Analyzer is a source code analysis tool that finds
bugs in C, C++, and Objective-C programs.

The standalone tool is invoked from the command line, and is intended
to be run in tandem with a build of a codebase.

The analyzer is 100% open source and is part of the Clang project.
Like the rest of Clang, the analyzer is implemented as a C++ library
that can be used by other tools and applications
