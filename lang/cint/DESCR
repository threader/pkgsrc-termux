Cint is a C/C++ interpreter. About 95% of ANSI C and 90% of C++ features are
covered. (Data abstraction,  class inheritance, virtual function, function and
operator overloading, default parameter, template,  etc...) Cint has source
code debugger which has sufficient capability to debug complicated C++ program.

This is officially the last release - CERN switched to cling (LLVM-based).
