PicoC is a very small C interpreter for scripting.  It was originally
written as the script language for a UAV's on-board flight system.
It's also very suitable for other robotic, embedded and non-embedded
applications.

The core C source code is around 4000 lines of code.  It's not
intended to be a complete implementation of ISO C but it has all the
essentials.  When compiled it only takes a few k of code space and is
also very sparing of data space.  This means it can work well in small
embedded devices.  It's also a fun example of how to create a very
small language implementation while still keeping the code readable.

picoc has been tested on x86-32, x86-64, powerpc, arm, ultrasparc,
HP-PA and blackfin processors and is easy to port to new targets.
