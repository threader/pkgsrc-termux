ECMAScript is a standardized language also known variously as JavaScript,
JScript, and LiveScript. SEE is a library that provides a parser and runtime
environment for this language. It conforms to ECMAScript Edition 3, and to
JavaScript 1.5, with some compatibility switches for earlier versions of
JavaScript and Microsoft's JScript.
