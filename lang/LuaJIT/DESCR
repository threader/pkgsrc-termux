LuaJIT is a Just-In-Time Compiler for the Lua programming language.

Lua is a powerful, light-weight programming language designed for extending
applications. Lua is also frequently used as a general-purpose, stand-alone
language. More information about Lua can be found at: http://www.lua.org/

LuaJIT is based on the Lua 5.1.x virtual machine and bytecode interpreter from
lua.org. It compiles bytecode to native x86 (i386+) machine code to speed up the
execution of Lua programs.
