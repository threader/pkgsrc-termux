PForth is an ANSI style Forth designed to be portable across many
platforms.  The 'P' in pForth stands for "Portable". PForth is based
on a Forth kernel written in ANSI standard 'C'.

PForth has been designed with portability as the primary design goal.
As a result, pForth avoids any fancy Unix calls. pForth also avoids
using any clever and original ways of constructing the Forth
dictionary. It just compiles its kernel from ANSI compatible 'C' code
then loads ANS compatible Forth code to build the dictionary.
Very boring but very likely to work on almost any platform.

The pForth software code is distributed under MIT licence with parts
dedicated to the public domain.
