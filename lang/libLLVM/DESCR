The LLVM Project is a collection of modular and reusable compiler and toolchain
technologies. Despite its name, LLVM has little to do with traditional virtual
machines, though it does provide helpful libraries that can be used to build
them.

This package contains the LLVM core shared libraries intended to be usable by
packages built on an otherwise GCC-built system.
