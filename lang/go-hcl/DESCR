HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) is a configuration language built by
HashiCorp. The goal of HCL is to build a structured configuration language that
is both human and machine friendly for use with command-line tools, but
specifically targeted towards DevOps tools, servers, etc.

HCL is also fully JSON compatible. That is, JSON can be used as completely
valid input to a system expecting HCL. This helps makes systems interoperable
with other systems.

HCL is heavily inspired by libucl, nginx configuration, and others similar.
