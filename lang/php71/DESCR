PHP is a widely-used open source general-purpose scripting language
that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded
into HTML. It is modular, and object-oriented. Much of its syntax
is borrowed from C, Java and Perl with a couple of unique PHP-specific
features thrown in.  The language is designed to allow web developers
to write dynamically generated pages quickly.

This package provides PHP version 7.1.x.

PHP 7.1.x builds upon 7.0.x, adding new features:

* Nullable types
* Void return type
* Iterable pseudo-type
* Class constant visibility modifiers
* Square bracket syntax for array destructuring assignment
* Catching multiple exceptions types
* HTTP/2 Server Push Support in ext/curl & other ext/curl improvements
* Fix inconsistent behavior in $this variable
* Create closure from callable
* More precise float values
* Asynchronous Signal Handling (without ticks) in ext/pcntl
