Jim is an opensource small-footprint implementation of the Tcl programming
language. It implements a large subset of Tcl and adds new features like
references with garbage collection, closures, built-in Object Oriented
Programming system, Functional Programming commands, first-class arrays and UTF-
8 support. All this with a binary size of about 100-200kB (depending upon
selected options).

The Jim core is very stable. Jim passes over 3000 unit tests and many Tcl
programs run unmodified. Jim is highly modular with the possiblity to configure
many components as loadable modules, or omitted entirely. A number of extensions
are included with Jim which may be built as loadable modules.
