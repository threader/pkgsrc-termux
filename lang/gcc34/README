1) You may want to adjust the "Optional languages"
   section of the Makefile before building this package.

2) The Ada compiler front-end of gcc is itself written
   in Ada. Consequently, an Ada compiler must be used
   to build it.

   Note however that in pkgsrc the lang/gcc-aux and/or
   lang/gnat-aux packages, which are substantially newer,
   are recommended instead of building the gcc34 Ada
   frontend.

   If you do wish to build the Ada compiler as part of this
   package you can download a pre-built version of gcc 3.4.0
   Ada for bootstrapping from:

   http://www.johnrshannon.com/NetBSD/ix86/gccAda-3.4.0.tgz
   http://www.johnrshannon.com/NetBSD/pentium4/gccAda-3.4.0.tgz
   http://www.johnrshannon.com/NetBSD/x86_64/gccAda-3.4.0.tgz

   The first two pkgs were built on NetBSD 2.0-BETA. The AMD64
   pkg was built under NetBSD 1.6ZL.
