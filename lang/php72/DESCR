PHP is a widely-used open source general-purpose scripting language
that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded
into HTML. It is modular, and object-oriented. Much of its syntax
is borrowed from C, Java and Perl with a couple of unique PHP-specific
features thrown in.  The language is designed to allow web developers
to write dynamically generated pages quickly.

This package provides PHP version 7.2.x.

PHP 7.2.x builds upon 7.1.x, adding new features:

* Argument type declarations
* Object return type declarations
* Parameter Type Widening
* Trailing commas in list syntax
* HashContext as Object
* Argon2 in password hash
* Libsodium as part of PHP Core
* Deprecated: __autoload, $php_errormsg, create_function(),
  mbstring.func_overload, parse_str() without second argument,
  gmp_random(), each(), assert(), $errcontext
* uniqid() patch to avoid usleep() integrated, 10000x improvement on NetBSD,
  about 10x on Linux
