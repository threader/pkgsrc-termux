This command is very raw and is therefore only partially implemented;
we present it here as a rough prototype for developers, not as a
general purpose tool for end users.

The xkbevd event daemon listens for specified XKB events and executes
requested commands if they occur.   The configuration file consists
of a list of event specification/action pairs and/or variable
definitions.
