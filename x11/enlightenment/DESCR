Enlightenment has grown to be much more than a window manager.
It has many systems that have grown on their own to support development
of the next version (0.17) and all the effort is going into solidifying
these systems to be more than solid to build on.
This has lead to a lot of code being produced that is useful far
and beyond a window manager. The idea is to share as much code
as possible with other programs, and so a small army of shared libraries
has evolved for Enlightenment. This page attempts to cover some
of these (especially the more interesting ones) to give a good insight
into why they exist, what they do, how to use them, and where they are going.
