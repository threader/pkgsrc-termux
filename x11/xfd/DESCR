The xfd utility creates a window containing the name of the font being
displayed, a row of command buttons, several lines of text for display-
ing character metrics, and a grid containing one glyph per cell.
The characters are shown in increasing order from left to right, top to
bottom.

This is the version of xfd maintained by Xorg.
