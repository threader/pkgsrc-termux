RX: X Remote eXecution
----------------------

The remote execution (RX) service specifies a MIME format for invoking
applications remotely, for example via a World Wide Web browser. This RX format
specifies a syntax for listing network services required by the application, for
example an X display server. The requesting Web browser must identify specific
instances of the services in the request to invoke the application.

The distribution contains a helper program (xrx) and a Mozilla family browser
plug-in (libxrx) that demonstrate this protocol. The plug-in was originally
written for Navigator 3.0, but has been used with later versions of the Mozilla
family of browsers, including Firefox.

The specification for the RX mime type is in the xorg-docs module in the X.Org
repository in specs/RX/RX.mif (FrameMaker interchange source) and
hardcopy/RX/RX.PS.Z (compressed PostScript).
