A kdrive based X Server which targets a window on a host X Server as its
framebuffer.

Unlike Xnest it supports modern X extensions (even if host server
doesn't) such as Composite, Damage, randr etc (no GLX support now). It
uses SHM Images and shadow framebuffer updates to provide good
performance. It also has a visual debugging mode for observing screen
updates.
