The X Rendering Extension introduces digital image composition as the
foundation of a rendering model within the X Window System.  Rendering
geometric figures is accomplished by client-side tessellation into either
triangles or trapezoids.  Text is drawn by loading glyphs into the server
and rendering sets of them.

This package contains the client library for connecting to a Xserver that
supports the Xrender extension.

This package is for use with older native X11 versions. The modular
X.org version is in x11/libXrender.
