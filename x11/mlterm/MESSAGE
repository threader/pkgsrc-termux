mlterm refers config files under ${PREFIX}/etc/mlterm as system default.
To use mlterm with per user configurations, you have to prepare own config
files under ~/.mlterm directory.  Please check and copy config files
(at least main, font, and font-fb) in ${PREFIX}/share/examples/mlterm
into ~/.mlterm and modify them per your preferable settings.
All available configurations are mentioned in the mlterm(1) man page.

To use mlterm-fb on NetBSD/amd64 and NetBSD/i386 console, you have to
enable VESA on the bootloader prompt.  You also have to modify the default
/etc/ttys settings to enable getty(8) at ttyE0 instead of console.
Please check NetBSD's boot(8) and ttys(5) man pages for these settings.

You might also have to install proper UTF-8 fonts like efont-unicode
to print multilingual characters.

Please also read the documentation in the directory
  ${PREFIX}/share/doc/mlterm
for more details.
