X proxy manager service:

The proxy manager (proxymngr) is responsible for resolving requests from
xfindproxy (and other similar clients), starting new proxies when appropriate,
and keeping track of all of the available proxy services. The proxy manager
strives to reuse existing proxies whenever possible.
