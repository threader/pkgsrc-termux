Whisker Menu is an alternate application launcher for Xfce.
When you open it you are shown a list of applications you
have marked as favorites. You can browse through all of your
installed applications by clicking on the category buttons on
the side. Top level categories make browsing fast, and simple
to switch between. Additionally, Whisker Menu keeps a list of
the last ten applications that you launched from it.
