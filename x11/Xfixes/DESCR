The X Fixes Extension provides workarounds for various limitations
in the core protocol.  The extension is designed to hold various
vaguely related extension bits that change how the X server and
clients interact with fundamental parts of the window system.

This package is for use with older native X11 versions. The modular
X.org version is in x11/libXfixes.
