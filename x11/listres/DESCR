The listres program generates a list of a widget's resource database.
The class in which each resource is first defined, the instance and
class name, and the type of each resource is listed. If no specific
widgets or the -all switch are given, a two-column list of widget names
and their class hierarchies is printed.

This is from the modular X.org X11 project.
