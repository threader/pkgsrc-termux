If xscreensaver is built with the "pam" option:
In order to make unlocking work , you need to add an
xscreensaver file to your pam configuration directory (usually
/etc/pam.d).  You can find a sample file in:
	${EGDIR}/pam.d/xscreensaver-NetBSD
On  NetBSD, the "pam_pwauth_suid.so" module can be used to authenticate
against a shadow password database. Note that use of this module might
allow programs with your privileges to get a copy of your plaintext
password as typed in for unlocking.
Alternatively, you might set the
	${PREFIX}/bin/xscreensaver
executable setuid root. Since this is a relatively complex program,
there is the risk of other exploits.
