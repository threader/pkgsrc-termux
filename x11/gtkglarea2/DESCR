Just as GTK+ is built on top of GDK, GtkGLArea is built on top of
gdkgl which is basically a wrapper around GLX functions. The widget
itself is derived from GtkDrawinigArea widget and adds only few
extra functions.  Lower level gdkgl functions make it easy to render
on any widget that has OpenGL capable visual, rendering to off-screen
pixmaps is also supported.
