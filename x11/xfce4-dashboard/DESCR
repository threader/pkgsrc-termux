xfdashboard provides a GNOME shell dashboard like interface for use with Xfce
desktop. It can be configured to run to any keyboard shortcut and when executed
provides an overview of applications currently open enabling the user to switch
between different applications. The search feature works like Xfce's app finder
which makes it convenient to search for and start applications.
