Hyena is a C# library used to make awesome applications. It contains
a lot of random things, including useful data structures, a
Sqlite-based db layer, cool widgets, a JSON library, a smart job/task
scheduler, a user-query/search parser, and much more. It's particularly
useful for Gtk# applications, though only the Hyena.Gui assembly
requires Gtk#.
