This is a little dockapp that does absolutely nothing except for sitting in
the dockapp area. It consumes very little resources. It is useful in
conjunction with a window manager that allows maximised windows to be
prevented from covering the dockapp area; it allows access to the root
window or menu even when windows are maximised.
