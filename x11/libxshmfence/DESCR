This library offers a CPU-based synchronization primitive compatible
with the X SyncFence objects that can be shared between processes
using file descriptor passing.

There are four underlying implementations:

 1) On Linux, the library uses futexes

 2) On FreeBSD, the library uses umtx

 3) On NetBSD, the library uses POSIX semaphores (for now)

 4) On other systems, the library uses posix mutexes and condition
    variables.
