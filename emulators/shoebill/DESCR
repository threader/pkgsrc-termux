Shoebill is an all-new, BSD-licensed Macintosh II emulator designed
from the ground up with the singular goal of running A/UX, first
presented on
<http://www.emaculation.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=8288>.

Shoebill requires a Macintosh II, IIx or IIcx ROM, e.g. from
<https://github.com/macmade/Macintosh-ROMs>, and a disk image with
A/UX installed.

Shoebill is different from other Macintosh emulators in how it
boots. Instead of booting directly into the Macintosh ROM, Shoebill
implements a bootloader and boots directly into A/UX
itself. Traditionally, A/UX is booted by first booting Mac OS, and
then running SASH/launch to mount the A/UX root partition, run fsck if
necessary, load the unix kernel, and then boot it. SASH provides the
ability to manipulate the A/UX filesystem while actually running in
regular Mac OS.

Shoebill cannot boot into regular Mac OS, although that's a future
goal. Instead, it replicates the functionality of Apple's bootloader,
and boots directly into A/UX.
