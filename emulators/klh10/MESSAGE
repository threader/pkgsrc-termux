To boot TOPS-20 with TCP/IP support, you will need to perform the
following steps.

In detail see ${PREFIX}/share/klh10/klt20.txt for TOPS-20 installation, and
http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/dec/pdp10/TOPS20/V7/INSTALL.MEM.txt
for TCP/IP installation.

In short, you should download the following magtape images from
http://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/tapes/ .
bb-h137f-bm.tap.bz2 for TOPS-20, and bb-ev83b-bm_longer.tap.bz2 for TCP/IP.

To run kn10-kl command, you should copy all binary in
${PREFIX}/share/klh10/bin to your TOPS-10 directory. And run
./kn10-kl configfile.ini .

To enable tap networking support, kn10-kl command may be run with root
privilege.
