 other host before telnetting back into the KN10.  A better solution
 would be to fix those OSes that are open-source, and push to have
 these fixes incorporated in the standard releases.
+	For NetBSD (it may work on FreeBSD too) there exists a better
+solution. A special configuration is created with a virtual ethernet
+segment that has its host-side in the form of the interface tap0 (as in
+the example below). The tap0 interface is bridged to the real network
+interface. The NI20 is at the "other end" of the virtual ethernet.
+(This differs from the other connectivity methods where the named
+interface is the one that is basically used as the NI20). The NI20 is
+therefore a dedicated interface:
+
+	devdef ni0 564 ni20 ipaddr=10.0.0.51 ifc=tap0 dedic=true
+
+If the named tap interface already exists, no further changes to its
+configuration are made. You can use this for alternative connectivity,
+such as routed on the 10.0.1.0/24 subnet (instead of bridged):
+
+	# To the shell, suppose your real network is 10.0.0.0/24,
+	# create a 10.0.1.0/24 network for KLH:
+	ifconfig tap0 create inet 10.0.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
+	; in .ini file:
