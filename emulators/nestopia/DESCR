NEStopia is a portable Nintendo Entertainment System emulator
written in C++ by Martin Freij and ported to Linux by R. Belmont.
NEStopia strives for the most accurate emulation possible at the
pixel-by-pixel and sample-by-sample level, and it has excellent
mapper and UNIF board support as well. A few features:

- Supports .nes and .unf/.unif format ROMs
- Supports .fds discs
- Supports .nsf music rips
- All supported files can be extracted from zip or 7zip containers (an
  archive browser is not yet included - this assumes the common
  GoodSet case of one zip or 7zip per game)
- Supports save states
- Supports movie recordings
- Supports the "rewinder" - if you make a bad jump and screw up your game,
  press Backspace and the game will run in reverse. Press \ to take over
  again and try to fix your mistake.
- Friendly GUI configuration
- Autodetection of PAL and NTSC format games
- Supports drag and drop of compatible games and music rips from modern
  Linux file managers, including KDE's Konqueror and GNOME's Nautilus.
