Dynagen is a front-end for use with the Dynamips Cisco router emulator.
It uses an INI-like configuration file to provision Dynamips emulator
networks. It takes care of specifying the right port adapters, generating
and matching up those pesky NIO descriptors, specifying bridges,
frame-relay, ATM switches, etc. It also provides a management CLI for
listing devices, suspending and reloading instances, determining and
managing idle-pc values, performing packet captures, etc.
