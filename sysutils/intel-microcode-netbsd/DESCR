The microcode data file contains the latest microcode definitions for all
Intel processors. Intel releases microcode updates to correct processor
behavior as documented in the respective processor specification updates.
While the regular approach to getting this microcode update is via a BIOS
upgrade, Intel realizes that this can be an administrative hassle. The Linux
operating system and VMware ESX products have a mechanism to update the
microcode after booting. For example, this file will be used by the
operating system mechanism if the file is placed in the /etc/firmware
directory of the Linux system.
