AMANDA, the Advanced Maryland Automatic Network Disk Archiver, is a
backup system that allows the administrator of a LAN to set up a single
master backup server to back up multiple hosts to a single large capacity
tape or disk drive. Amanda uses native tools (such as GNUtar, dump) for
backup and can back up a large number of workstations running multiple
versions of Unix/Mac OS X/Linux/Windows.
