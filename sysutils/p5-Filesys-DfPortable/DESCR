This module provides a portable way to obtain filesystem disk space
information.

The module should work with all versions of Windows (95 and up), and with all
flavors of Unix that implement the statvfs or the statfs calls. This would
include Linux, *BSD, HP-UX, AIX, Solaris, Mac OS X, Irix, Cygwin, etc ...

This module differs from Filesys::Df in that it has added support for
Windows, but does not support open filehandles as a argument.
