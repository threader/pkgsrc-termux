Smbldap-tools is a set of scripts designed to help integrate Samba and
a LDAP directory.  They target both users and administrators of unix
systems.

Users can change their password in a way similar to the standard
`passwd' command.

Administrators can perform user and group management command line
actions and synchronise Samba account management consistently.

A version of these tools are bundled with samba, but this set is from
the master development site and is generally more up to date.
