The library allows a process to change its title (as displayed by
system tools such as ps and top).

Changing the title is mostly useful in multi-process systems, for
example when a master process is forked: changing the children's
title allows to identify the task each process is busy with.  The
technique is used by PostgreSQL and the OpenSSH Server for example.
