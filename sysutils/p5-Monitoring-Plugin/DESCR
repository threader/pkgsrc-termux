Monitoring::Plugin and its associated Monitoring::Plugin::* modules are
a family of perl modules to streamline writing Monitoring plugins. The
main end user modules are Monitoring::Plugin, providing an
object-oriented interface to the entire Monitoring::Plugin::*
collection, and Monitoring::Plugin::Functions, providing a simpler
functional interface to a useful subset of the available functionality.
