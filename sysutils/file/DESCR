File tests each argument in an attempt to classify it.  There are
three sets of tests, performed in this order: file system tests,
magic number tests, and language tests.

This package also includes the magic number recognition libraries.

This implementation of file(1) is the standard "file" command for
Linux, *BSD, and other systems.  It (as well as the magic file)
was originally written by Ian Darwin and is now maintained by a
group of developers lead by Christos Zoulas.
