System Stability Tester tries to test the system's stability by
calculating up to 128 millions of Pi digits. It supports multiple
calculation algorithms. For the moment only two have been implemented.
The Quadratic Convergence of Borwein and Gauss-Legendre, the
algorithm SuperPi uses. The testing process includes the creation
of two or more threads. After each step of the calculation, the
results of all the threads are compared. Any differences between
them are reported. There is also the option for single threaded
calculation, but in this case there is no stability check. This is
useful for benchmarking purposes only. The calculation of Pi itself
is multi threaded since version 0.7.2, for the Borwein algorithm
only.
