These tools are only useful when NetBSD is running as a paravirtualised
guest within XenServer.

Your domU kernel must provide /kern/xen/xenbus. Support was added to NetBSD
HEAD and netbsd-5 source trees on 23rd September 2011.

Please update your xenguest rc.d script after upgrading to v6.5.0 of this
package (or later).
