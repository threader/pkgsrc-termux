NetBSD can run as a paravirtualised guest of Citrix XenServer using
XEN3PAE_DOMU (i386) or XEN3_DOMU (amd64) kernels. To get full
functionality, guest VMs must provide run-time information to the
XenServer dom0. Failure to do so will give the message "XenServer
Tools not installed".

This package allows NetBSD to interface with XenServer to enable:
- Memory usage logging
- IP address reporting
- Suspend/Resume
- Migration
- OS version reporting
