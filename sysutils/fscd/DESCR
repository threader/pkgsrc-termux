fscd (FreeBSD service check daemon) is a daemon that monitors and checks the
status of running services started by rc(8). It connects to started services via
kqueue(2) and will be noticed when the service terminates, trying to restart it
via service(8).

fscd is controlled with the fscadm(8) utility to enable and disable service
monitoring.
