DeviceKit is an abstraction for enumerating devices and listening
to device events. Any application on the system can access the
org.freedesktop.DeviceKit service via the system message bus. On
GNU/Linux, DeviceKit can be considered a simple D-Bus frontend to
udev(7).

This is a modified version of the DeviceKit daemon for NetBSD.
