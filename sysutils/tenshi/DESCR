tenshi is a log monitoring program, designed to watch one or more log files for
lines matching user defined regular expressions and report on the matches. The
regular expressions are assigned to queues which have an alert interval and a
list of mail recipients.

Queues can be set to send a notification as soon as there is a log line
assigned to it, or to send periodic reports.
