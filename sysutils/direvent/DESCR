Direvent is a directory content watcher daemon, i.e. a program that
monitors a set of directories on the file system and reacts when
their content changes. When a change is detected, the daemon reacts by
invoking an external command configured for that kind of change.

The program aims to provide a uniform and system-independent
command-level interface for file system events.
