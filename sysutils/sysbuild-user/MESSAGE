A new system user has been set up to perform daily rebuilds of NetBSD for
the current platform.  Please take the time to review the following file:

	${SYSBUILD_HOME}/default.conf

And make sure that the installed cron job runs at appropriate times:

	crontab -u ${SYSBUILD_USER} -e

Lastly, remember that you can trigger manual sysbuild operations by doing:

	su - ${SYSBUILD_USER} ${PREFIX}/bin/sysbuild <arguments>
