Augeas is a configuration editing tool. It parses configuration files in
their native formats and transforms them into a tree. Configuration
changes are made by manipulating this tree and saving it back into
native config files.

Augeas is:
- An API provided by a C library
- A command line tool to manipulate configuration from the shell (and
  shell scripts)
- Language bindings to do the same from your favorite scripting language
- Canonical tree representations of common configuration files
- A domain-specific language to describe configuration file formats


Augeas goals:
- Manipulate configuration files safely, safer than the ad-hoc
  techniques generally used with grep, sed, awk and similar mechanisms
  in scripting languages
- Provide a local configuration API for Linux
- Make it easy to integrate new config files into the Augeas tree
