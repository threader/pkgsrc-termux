Fabric is an incredible tool to automate administration of remote machines.
As Fabric's functions are rather low-level, you'll probably quickly see a need
for more high-level functions such as add/remove users and groups,
install/upgrade packages, etc.

Cuisine is a small set of functions that sit on top of Fabric, to abstract
common administration operations such as file/dir operations, user/group
creation, package install/upgrade, making it easier to write portable
administration and deployment scripts.

Cuisine's features are:

* Small, easy to read, a single file API:
  <object>_<operation>() e.g. dir_exists(location) tells if there is a
  remote directory at the given location.
* Covers file/dir operations, user/group operations, package operations
* Text processing and template functions
* All functions are lazy: they will actually only do things when the change
  is required.
