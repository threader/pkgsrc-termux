K4DirStat (KDE 4 Directory Statistics) is a small utility program that
sums up disk usage for directory trees, very much like the Unix 'du'
command. It displays the disk space used up by a directory tree, both
numerically and graphically. It is network transparent (i.e., you can use
it to sum up FTP servers), and comes with predefined and user configurable
cleanup actions. You can directly open a directory branch in Konqueror or
the shell of your choice, compress it to a .tar.bz2 archive, or define
your own cleanup actions.
