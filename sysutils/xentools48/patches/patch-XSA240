Subject: [PATCH 2/2] x86/mm: Disable PV linear pagetables by default

Allowing pagetables to point to other pagetables of the same level
(often called 'linear pagetables') has been included in Xen since its
inception.  But it is not used by the most common PV guests (Linux,
NetBSD, minios), and has been the source of a number of subtle
reference-counting bugs.

Add a command-line option to control whether PV linear pagetables are
allowed (disabled by default).
