Kernel modules allow the system administrator to dynamically add and
remove functionality from a running system.  This ability also helps
software developers to develop new parts of the kernel without constantly
rebooting to test their changes.

This package provides the necessary utilities for using kernel modules on
NetBSD 5.x.

The modload utility loads a kernel module specified by the module parameter
into the running system. The modunload utility unloads a loadable kernel
module from a running system. The modstat utility displays the status of
any kernel modules present in the kernel.
