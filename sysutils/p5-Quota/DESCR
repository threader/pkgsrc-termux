The Quota module provides access to file system quotas.

The quotactl system call or ioctl or libquota is used to query or set
quotas on the local host, or queries are submitted via RPC to a remote
host. Mount tables can be parsed with getmntent and paths can be
translated to device files (or whatever the actual quotactl
implementations needs as argument) of the according file system.
