The guest environment denotes the Google provided configuration and tooling
inside of a Google Compute Engine (GCE) virtual machine. The metadata server is
a communication channel for transferring information from a client into the
guest.  The guest environment includes a set of scripts and daemons (long
running processes) that read the content of the metadata server to make a
virtual machine run properly on our platform.

You probably do not need this package unless you are running in a virtual
machine on Google Compute Engine.
