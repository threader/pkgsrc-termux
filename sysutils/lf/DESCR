lf (as in "list files") is a terminal file manager written in Go. It is heavily
inspired by ranger with some missing and extra features. Some of the missing
features are deliberately ommited since it is better if they are handled by
external tools.

Features

- no external runtime dependencies (except for terminfo database)
- fast startup and low memory footprint (due to native code and static
  binaries)
- server/client architecture to share selection between multiple instances
- custom commands as shell scripts (hence any other language as well)
- sync (waiting and skipping) and async commands
- fully customizable keybindings

Non-Features

- tabs or windows (handled by the window manager or the terminal multiplexer)
- built-in pager (handled by your pager of choice)
