virtinst is a module to help in starting installations of Fedora/Red
Hat Enterprise Linux related distributions inside of virtual
machines.  It supports both paravirt guests (for which only FC and
RHEL guests are currently supported) as well as fully virtualized
guests.  It uses libvirt (http://www.libvirt.org) for starting
things.
