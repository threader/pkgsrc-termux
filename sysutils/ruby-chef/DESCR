Chef is a configuration management tool.  It uses a pure-Ruby,
domain-specific language (DSL) for writing system configuration
"recipes".  Chef is used to streamline the task of configuring and
maintaining a company's servers, and can integrate with cloud-based
platforms such as Rackspace, Amazon EC2, and Microsoft Azure to
automatically provision and configure new machines.
