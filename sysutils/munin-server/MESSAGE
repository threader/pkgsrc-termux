You can start the collection of statistics and production of graphs by
installing a crontab for the ${MUNIN_USER} user of the form

*/5 * * * * ${PREFIX}/bin/munin-cron

You may need to give ${MUNIN_USER} a valid shell to do so.


You may also want to add lines like

${VARBASE}/log/munin/munin-graph.log  munin:munin 644 7 *    24   Z
${VARBASE}/log/munin/munin-html.log   munin:munin 644 7 *    24   Z
${VARBASE}/log/munin/munin-limits.log munin:munin 644 7 *    24   Z
${VARBASE}/log/munin/munin-update.log munin:munin 644 7 *    24   Z

to your /etc/newsyslog.conf file to have the logs rotated.


'htmldir' should be owned by ${MUNIN_USER}; a subdirectory
named after munin's domain name should exist there for
munin-graph to work.  You also need to copy HTML templates from
${PREFIX}/share/examples/munin/templates to 'tmpldir'.
