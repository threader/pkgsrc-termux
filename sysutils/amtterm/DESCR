   What is AMT and why I should care?
       AMT stands for "Active Management Technology".  It provides some remote
       management facilities.  They are handled by the hardware and  firmware,
       thus  they work independant from the operation system.  Means: It works
       before Linux bootet up to the point  where  it  activated  the  network
       interface.   It works even when your most recent test kernel deadlocked
       the machine.  Which makes it quite useful for development machines  ...

       Intel  AMT  is  part  of the vPro Platform.  Recent intel-chipset based
       business machines should have it.  My fairly new Intel SDV machine  has
       it too.
