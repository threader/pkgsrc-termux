Monitoring is an API with a DSL feel to write monitoring daemons in Python.

Monitoring works well for the following tasks:

* to be notified when incidents happen (email, XMPP, ZeroMQ...)
* automatic actions to be taken (restart, rm, git pull...)
* to collect system statistics for further processing e.g. graphs
* tie into existing/third-party Python code
* play along nicely with existing deployment/configuration ecosystem
  (fabric/cuisine)

Overview

* monitoring DSL: declarative programming to define monitoring strategy
* wide spectrum: from data collection and incident reporting to taking
  automatic actions
* Small, easy to read, a single file API
* Revised BSD License

Use Cases

* ensure service availability: test and start/stop when problems
* collect system statistics/data, log locally and/or remotely
* alert on system/service health, take actions
