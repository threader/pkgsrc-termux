unburden-home-dir allows users to move cache files from browsers,
etc. off their (nfs or ssd based) home directory, i.e. on a local
harddisk or tmpfs and replace them with a symbolic link to the new
location (e.g. on /tmp/ or /scratch/) upon login.

Optionally the contents of these directories and files can be removed
instead of moved.
