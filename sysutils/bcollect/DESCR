bcollect is a tool for backing up remote hosts to local directories. It
can keep a defined number of copies for specific backup intervals to
give you a backlog of available backups for restoring data.

bcollect keeps its backups directly accessible as files and directories
so you can search through them and access files with regular tools and
just copy files back as needed.

In order to save space, bcollect uses hardlinks between different
instances of the same backed-up host so multiple backups don't take up
the same space multiple times. Only files which are actually different
between two backups actually occupy space. If the file has not been
changed, a reference will be created to the original file.
