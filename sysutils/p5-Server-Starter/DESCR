It is often a pain to write a server program that supports graceful
restarts, with no resource leaks. The Perl 5 module Server::Starter,
solves the problem by splitting the task into two. One is start_server,
a script provided as a part of the module, which works as a superdaemon
that binds to one or more TCP ports, and repeatedly spawns the
server program that actually handles the incomming commenctions.
The spawned server programs under Server::Starter call accept(2)
and handle the requests.
