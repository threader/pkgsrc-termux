etckeeper is a collection of tools to let /etc be stored in a git,
mercurial, darcs, or bzr repository. It hooks into apt (and other
package managers including yum and pacman-g2) to automatically commit
changes made to /etc during package upgrades. It tracks file metadata
that revison control systems do not normally support, but that is
important for /etc, such as the permissions of /etc/shadow.
It's quite modular and configurable, while also being simple to use
if you understand the basics of working with revision control.
