Interface for statvfs() and fstatvfs()

Unless access to the bsize, flag, and namemax values is required, either
Filesys::DfPortable or Filesys::Df could be a better choice.  They will
generally provide more functionality and portability.

The module should work with all flavors of Unix that implement the statvfs()
and fstatvfs() calls. This would include Linux, *BSD, HP-UX, AIX, Solaris,
Mac OS X, Irix, Cygwin, etc ...
