etcutils is a package that provides standalone utilities to manipulate some
of the configuration files in /etc in a programmatic manner.  Some of these
files can be seen as databases and, as such, they should have tools to
update them.

The utilities provided by etcutils are designed to permit their integration
into packaging systems.  Once integrated, packages can use these tools to
automatically modify these system-wide configuration files without having
to care about portability issues.  Of course, these utilities provide a
command-line interface that resembles that of other standard tools, and
thus their manual usage is also possible.

The following utilities are provided:

* services(8): Add, list, remove and check the presence of entries in the
  services(5) database.

* shells(8): Add, list, remove and check the presence of entries in the
  shells(5) database.
