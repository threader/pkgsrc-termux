it's successors, that's why the 'x' in the package name.

fexc:
	`.fex` file (de)compiler

	Usage: ./fexc [-vq] [-I <infmt>] [-O <outfmt>] [<input> [<output>]]

	infmt:  fex, bin  (default:fex)
	outfmt: fex, bin  (default:bin)

bin2fex:
	compatibility shortcut to call `fexc` to decompile an script.bin
	blob back into `.fex` format used by allwinner's SDK to configure
	the boards.

fex2bin:
	compatiblity shortcut to call `fexc` to compile a `.fex` file into
	the binary form used by the sun4i kernel.

fel:
	script interface for talking to the FEL USB handler built in to

	button at poweron. See http://linux-sunxi.org/FEL/USBBoot for
	a detailed usage guide.

fel-gpio:
	Simple wrapper around fel-pio and fel to allow GPIO manipulations
	via FEL

fel-sdboot:
	ARM native sdcard bootloader forcing the device into FEL mode

fel-pio:
	ARM native helper for fel-gpio

pio:
	Manipulate PIO register dumps

jtag-loop.sunxi:
	ARM native boot helper to force the SD port into JTAG
	and then stop, to ease debugging of bootloaders.

bootinfo:
	Dump information from Allwinner boot files (boot0/boot1)
	--type=sd	include SD boot info
	--type=nand	include NAND boot info (not implemented)
