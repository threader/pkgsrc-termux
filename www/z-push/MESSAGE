For pkgsrc installations, Z-push is installed with non-default locations:

	Z-push directory:	${ZPUSHDIR}
	Documentation:		${DOCDIR}

To complete the installation of Z-push, follow these steps:

1. Configure Z-push to use the different servers you want it to support.
   The configuration file is extensively documented:

	Configuration file:	${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/config.php

2. You will need to make Z-push accessible through your HTTP server.
   If you are running Apache and ap-php, you can use the following file:

        ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/z-push.conf

   and add an Include directive directly within Apache configuration:

        Include ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/z-push.conf

   If you are not using Apache:

    - make Z-push `index.php' accessible directly through the
      URL `/Microsoft-Server-ActiveSync'

    - set the following PHP flags for the Z-push directory:

	php_flag magic_quotes_gpc off
	php_flag register_globals off
	php_flag magic_quotes_runtime off
	php_flag short_open_tag on

    - adjust the owner and group of the following directories to match
      the ones corresponding to your webserver:

	${ZPUSHSTATEDIR}  mode=0750
	${ZPUSHLOGDIR}    mode=0750
	${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/config.php mode=0640

   See Z-push online documentation for further information or refer
   to the INSTALL file:

	${HOMEPAGE}
	${DOCDIR}/INSTALL
