Heel is a small static web server for use when you need a quick web server for a
directory. Once the server is running, heel will use launchy
(http://copiousfreetime.rubyforge.org/launchy/) to open your browser at the URL
of your document root.  Heel is built using Rack(http://rack.rubyforge.org) and
Thin (http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/)
