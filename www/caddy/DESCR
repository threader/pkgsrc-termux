Caddy is a HTTP/2 web server with automatic HTTPS.

Caddy was born out of the need for a "batteries-included" web server
that runs anywhere and doesn't have to take its configuration with it.
Caddy took inspiration from spark, nginx, lighttpd, Websocketd and
Vagrant, which provides a pleasant mixture of features from each of
them.
