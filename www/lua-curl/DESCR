Lua support for libcurl.

Connect and communicate to many different types of servers with many
different types of protocols.

This project is not a fork of LuaCURL, which is a direct mapping of
parts of the libcurl-easy interface.

The intent of Lua-cURL is to adapt the

    * Easy Interface
    * Multi Interface
    * Shared Interface

of libcurl to the functionality of Lua (for example by using iterators
instead of callbacks when possible).
