Handel is a cart/order/checkout framework with AxKit taglib support
, TT2 (Template Toolkit) support and Catalyst::Helper support. It
was created for the conversion of an IIS/ASP based commerce site
to Apache/ModPerl, but I decided that it might be useful to others
so here it is.

For the curious, Handel is German for commerce.
