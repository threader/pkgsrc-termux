Yaws is a HTTP high perfomance 1.1 webserver particularly well suited for
dynamic-content webapplications. Two separate modes of operations are
supported:
 * Standalone mode where Yaws runs as a regular webserver daemon.
   This is the default mode.
 * Embedded mode where Yaws runs as an embedded webserver in another
   erlang application.

Yaws is entirely written in Erlang furthermore it is a multithreaded webserver
where one Erlang light weight process is used to handle each client.

The main advantages of yaws compared to other Web technologies are performance
and elegance. The performance comes from the underlying Erlang system and its
ability to handle concurrent processes in an efficent way. Its elegance comes
from Erlang as well. Web applications dont have to be written in ugly adhoc
languages.
