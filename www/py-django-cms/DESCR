A Django app for managing hierarchical pages of content in multiple languages,
on different sites. Django CMS handles the navigation rendering for you in
multiple languages with internationalization (i18n) slugs, and the navigation
can be extended by your own models. Pages are rendered with a template that
has placeholders which get filled via plugins.
