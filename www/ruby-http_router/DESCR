# HTTP Router

## What is it?

This is an HTTP router for use in either a web framework, or on it's own using
Rack. It takes a set of routes and attempts to find the best match for
it. Take a look at the examples directory for how you'd use it in the Rack
context.

## Features

* Ordered route resolution.
* Supports variables, and globbing, both named and unnamed.
* Regex support for variables.
* Request condition support.
* Partial matches.
* Supports interstitial variables (e.g.
  /my-:variable-brings.all.the.boys/yard) and unnamed variable /one/:/two
* Very fast and small code base (~1,000 loc).
* Sinatra via https://github.com/joshbuddy/http_router_sinatra
