The Perl 5 module Net::FastCGI aims to provide a complete API for
working with the FastCGI protocol.  The primary goal is to provide
a function oriented and object oriented API which are not tied to
a specific I/O model or framework.  Secondary goal is to provide
higher level tools/API which can be used for debugging and
interoperability testing.
