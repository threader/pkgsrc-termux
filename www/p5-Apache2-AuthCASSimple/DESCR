Apache2::AuthCASSimple is an authentication module for Apache2/mod_perl2.
It allows you to authenticate users through a Yale CAS server. Users
do not need to log in if they are already authenticated
by the CAS server, only tickets are exchanged between Web client,
Apache2 server and CAS server. If they are not yet authenticated,
they will be redirected to the CAS server login form.
