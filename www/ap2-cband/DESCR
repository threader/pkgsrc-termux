mod_cband - A per-user, per-virtualhost and per-destination bandwidth
limiter for the Apache HTTP Server Version 2

mod_cband is an Apache 2 module provided to solve the problem of limiting
users' and virtualhosts' bandwidth usage. The current versions can set
virtualhosts' and users' bandwidth quotas, maximal download speed (like in
mod_bandwidth), requests-per-second speed and the maximal number of
simultanous IP connections (like in mod_limitipconn).
