Geckodriver provides the HTTP API described by the W3C WebDriver protocol to
communicate with Gecko browsers, such as Firefox. It translates calls into
the Firefox remote protocol by acting as a proxy between the local- and remote
ends. This is used by browser automation frameworks such as Selenium.
