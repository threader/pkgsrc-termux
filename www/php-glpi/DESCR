GLPI is an Information Resource Manager application with an additional
Administration Interface. You can use it to build up a database with
an inventory for your company (computers, software, printers, etc).

Its enhanced functionality makes daily life for administrators easier.
Besides an inventory, it provides a trouble-ticket system, job
tracking with mail notification, and methods to build a database with
basic information about your network-topology.
