This module implements a very simple parser for cookies used in
HTTP applications. We've found CGI::Simple::Cookie and CGI::Cookie
rather slow according to the profiling results for our OpenResty
project, hence the rewrite in C.

WARNING: This module is obsolete; please use CGI::Cookie::XS instead.
