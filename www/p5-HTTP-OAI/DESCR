HTTP::OAI is a stub module.

HTTP::OAI::Harvester is the harvesting front-end in the OAI-PERL library.

To harvest from an OAI-PMH compliant repository create an HTTP::OAI::Harvester
object using the baseURL option and then call OAI-PMH methods to request data
from the repository. To handle version 1.0/1.1 repositories automatically you
must request Identify() first.

It is recommended that you request an Identify from the Repository and use the
repository() method to update the Identify object used by the harvester.

When making OAI requests the underlying HTTP::OAI::UserAgent module will take
care of automatic redirection (http code 302) and retry-after (http code 503).
OAI-PMH flow control (i.e. resumption tokens) is handled transparently by
HTTP::OAI::Response.
