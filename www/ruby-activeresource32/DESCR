Active Resource (ARes) connects business objects and Representational
State Transfer (REST) web services.

It implements object-relational mapping for REST web services to
provide transparent proxying capabilities between a client
(ActiveResource) and a RESTful service (which is provided by Simply
RESTful routing in ActionController::Resources).
