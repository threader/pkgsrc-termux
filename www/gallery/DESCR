Gallery 1 is a web-based photo album suitable for small to medium-sized
photo collections. Unlike Gallery 2, Gallery 1 does not need a database
backend. It provides users with the ability to create and maintain their
own albums via an intuitive web interface. Photo management includes
automatic thumbnail creation, image resizing, rotation, ordering,
captioning, searching and more.
