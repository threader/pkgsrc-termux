This module implements a www-like shell above WWW::Mechanize and also has the
capability to output crude Perl code that recreates the recorded session.
Its main use is as an interactive starting point for automating a session
through WWW::Mechanize.
The cookie support is there, but no cookies are read from your existing browser
