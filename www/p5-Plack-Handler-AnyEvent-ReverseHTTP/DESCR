The Perl 5 module Plack::Handler::AnyEvent::ReverseHTTP is Plack
handler that runs your PSGI application on AnyEvent::ReverseHTTP.
It uses ReverseHTTP gateway to access your PSGI application on your
desktop or behind the firewall from the internet. Just like Ruby's
hookout does with Rack applications.
