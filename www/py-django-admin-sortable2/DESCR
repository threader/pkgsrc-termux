A replacement for django-admin-sortable using an unintrusive approach.

This plugin is a generic drag-and-drop ordering module for sorting objects in
the List, the Stacked- and the Tabular-Inlines Views in the Django Admin
interface.

This module offers simple mixin classes which enrich the functionality of any
existing class derived from admin.ModelAdmin, admin.StackedInline or
admin.TabularInline.

Thus it makes it very easy to integrate with existing models and their model
admin interfaces. Existing models can inherit from models.Model or any other
class derived thereof. No special base class is required.
