Often in web apps, tests are very dependent on the state set up by
previous tests. If one test fails (e.g. "follow the link to the
admin page") then it's likely there will be many more failures.
The Perl 5 module Test::WWW::Declare module aims to alleviate this
problem, as well as provide a nicer interface to Test::WWW::Mechanize.
