Ikiwiki is a wiki compiler. It converts wiki pages into HTML pages
suitable for publishing on a website. Ikiwiki stores pages and
history in a revision control system such as Subversion or Git.
There are many other features, including support for blogging and
podcasting, as well as a large array of plugins.

If you're familiar with static site generators, think of ikiwiki
as a particularly flexible SSG with some dynamic features.
