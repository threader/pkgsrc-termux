SQL Explorer aims to make the flow of data between people fast, simple, and
confusion-free.

Quickly write and share SQL queries for any Django app in a simple, usable SQL
editor, preview the results in the browser, share links to download CSV files,
and keep the information flowing!

Explorer values simplicity, intuitive use, unobtrusiveness, stability, and the
principle of least surprise.

Django SQL Explorer is inspired by any number of great query and reporting
tools out there.
