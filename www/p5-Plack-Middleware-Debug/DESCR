The Perl 5 module Plack::Middleware::Debug is a Plack middleware.
It offers a configurable set of panels that displays information
about the current request and response. The information is generated
only for responses with a status of 200 (OK) and a Content-Type
that contains text/html or application/xhtml+xml and is embedded
in the HTML that is sent back to the browser.
