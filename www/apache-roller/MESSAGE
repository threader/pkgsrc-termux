As apache-roller can be used with a number of Servlet containers a
number of manual steps must be completed:

1. Create the database for roller
2. Include the JDBC driver on your CLASSPATH
   (The driver is currently installed in ${PREFIX}/lib/java)
3. Modify the roller-custom.properties file and place it on your CLASSPATH
   (A sample is suppied in ${PREFIX}/share/examples/apache-roller)
4. Deploy the roller WAR file
   (The WAR file can be found in ${PREFIX}/share/apache-roller)

See the Apache roller docs for the full installation details.
