e this plugin if you wish to selectively force SSL mode on some of
your web pages, for example a user login form or shopping cart.

Simply place $c->require_ssl calls in any controller method you
wish to be secured.

This plugin will automatically disable itself if you are running
under the standalone HTTP::Daemon Catalyst server. A warning message
will be printed to the log file whenever an SSL redirect would have
occurred.
