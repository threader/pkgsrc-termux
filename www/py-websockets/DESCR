websockets is a library for developing WebSocket servers and clients in
Python. It implements RFC 6455 with a focus on correctness and simplicity.
It passes the Autobahn Testsuite.

Built on top of Python's asynchronous I/O support introduced in PEP 3156,
it provides an API based on coroutines, making it easy to write highly
concurrent applications.
