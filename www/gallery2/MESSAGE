For pkgsrc installations, Gallery2 is installed with the following
locations:

	Document root:		${G2DIR}
	Data directory:		${G2DATA}

You will need to make Gallery2 accessible through your HTTP server.
If you are running Apache and ap-php, you can use the following file:

	${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/gallery2.conf

and add an Include directive directly within Apache configuration:

	Include ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/gallery2.conf
