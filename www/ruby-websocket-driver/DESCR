Websocket-driver module provides a complete implementation of
the WebSocket protocols that can be hooked up to any TCP library.
It aims to simplify things by decoupling the protocol details
from the I/O layer, such that users only need to implement code
to stream data in and out of it without needing to know anything
about how the protocol actually works. Think of it as a complete
WebSocket system with pluggable I/O.
