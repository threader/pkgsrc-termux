Sanic is a Flask-like Python 3.5+ web server that's written to go fast. It's
based on the work done by the amazing folks at magicstack.

On top of being Flask-like, Sanic supports async request handlers. This means
you can use the new shiny async/await syntax from Python 3.5, making your code
non-blocking and speedy.
