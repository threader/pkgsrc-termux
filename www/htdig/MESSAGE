The sample ${PREFIX}/bin/rundig script may be run to create a database
in the newly created empty directory, ${DBDIR}. A sample search
form, which may be used to search that database, has been installed to
${PREFIX}/share/examples/htdig/search.html.

For an example of how to set up ht://Dig and integrate it with your web
site, you may wish to examine the scripts installed into
/var/wwwoffle/html/htdig/scripts by the www/wwwoffle package.
