llgal is a HTML gallery generator for images, videos, text and links.
It is based on igal and adds supports for various types of slides
including movies, text, links and subdirectories and several features
such as the addition of headers and footers in generated HTML files or
the generation of slide captions from JFIF, GIF or EXIF comments.
llgal generates nice web-pages through very simple HTML code that does
not require anything like php or javascript.
