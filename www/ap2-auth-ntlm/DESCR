NTLM is an authentication protocol used by Microsoft Internet Informations
Server(tm) and Microsoft Internet Explorer(tm). While it is not really
secure, it offers background authentication (the workstation logon
credentials of users are passed through to the web server). This feature is
widely used in intranets based on these Microsoft products.

This module is implementing NTLM authentication for Apache on Unix
platforms. It is available free of charges under the BSD License.
