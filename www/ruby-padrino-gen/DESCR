= Agnostic Application Generators (padrino-gen)

=== Overview

Padrino comes preloaded with flexible code generators powered in part by the
excellent Thor gem (incidentally also used in the Rails 3 generators).

These generators are intended to allow for easy code generation both in
creating new applications and building on existing ones.

The generators have been built to be as library agnostic as possible,
supporting a myriad of test frameworks, js libraries, mocking libraries, etc.
