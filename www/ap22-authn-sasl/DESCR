This module provides the mod_auth_basic authentication front-end a way to
authenticate users by checking credentials via the Cyrus SASL library.
This may be interesting for setups where other daemons (e.g. for SMTP, IMAP
or LDAP) already running at a machine use SASL to authenticate users. The
module is also useful to authenticate users against databases that use shadow
passwords. You do not need to elevate Apache HTTPD's access rights to
superuser privileges.
