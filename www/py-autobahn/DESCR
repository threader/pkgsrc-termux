Autobahn|Python is a subproject of Autobahn and provides open-source
implementations of

    The WebSocket Protocol
    The Web Application Messaging Protocol (WAMP)

for Python 2 and 3, and running on Twisted and asyncio.

You can use Autobahn|Python to create clients and servers in Python
speaking just plain WebSocket or WAMP.

WebSocket allows bidirectional real-time messaging on the Web and
beyond, while WAMP adds real-time application communication on top
of WebSocket.

WAMP provides asynchronous Remote Procedure Calls and Publish &
Subscribe for applications in one protocol running over WebSocket.
WAMP is a routed protocol, so you need a WAMP Router to connect
your Autobahn|Python based clients. We provide Crossbar.io, but
there are other options as well.
