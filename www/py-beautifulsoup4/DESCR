Beautiful Soup is a Python library designed for quick turnaround projects like
screen-scraping. Three features make it powerful:

 * Beautiful Soup provides a few simple methods and Pythonic idioms for
   navigating, searching, and modifying a parse tree: a toolkit for dissecting a
   document and extracting what you need. It doesn't take much code to write an
   application
 * Beautiful Soup automatically converts incoming documents to Unicode and
   outgoing documents to UTF-8. You don't have to think about encodings, unless
   the document doesn't specify an encoding and Beautiful Soup can't autodetect
   one. Then you just have to specify the original encoding.
 * Beautiful Soup sits on top of popular Python parsers like lxml and html5lib,
   allowing you to try out different parsing strategies or trade speed for
   flexibility.

Beautiful Soup parses anything you give it, and does the tree traversal stuff
for you. You can tell it "Find all the links", or "Find all the links of class
externalLink", or "Find all the links whose urls match "foo.com", or "Find the
table heading that's got bold text, then give me that text."

Valuable data that was once locked up in poorly-designed websites is now within
your reach. Projects that would have taken hours take only minutes with
Beautiful Soup.
