perl5 module HTTP::Negotiate provides a complete implementation of the
HTTP content negotiation algorithm specified in
draft-ietf-http-v11-spec-00.ps chapter 12.
Content negotiation allows for the selection of a preferred content
representation based upon attributes of the negotiable variants and
the value of the various Accept* header fields in the request.
