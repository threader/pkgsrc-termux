perl_install cause the Makefile in perl/ to be rebuilt with /usr/pkg/lib
as library path instead of the source tree. install the tries to relink
the target with the new path, which fails because the just-installed
libraries are not in the buildlink directory.
Just don't rebuild makefiles, the run-time search path has been fixed
by buildlink already.
