Innate is the core of Ramaze, but useful on its own. The philosophy behind
Innate is to provide a simple web-framework that:

* Stays below 2000 easily readable lines of code
* Has Rack as the only dependency
* Provides the default helpers
* Is easy to encapsulate and reuse in other contexts as a simple rack app
* Has a rock-solid and fast implementation
* Scores at least 95% in rcov
* Is fully documented using YARD
