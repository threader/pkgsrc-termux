This module parses HTTP headers using a C++ state machine. (Hence
this being an XS module.) The goal is to be fast, not necessarily
to do everything you could ever want.

Headers are not static, you can parse them, munge them, or even
build them using this module. See the SYNOPSIS for more information
on how to use this module.
