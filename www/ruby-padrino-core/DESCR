= Padrino (padrino-core)

Padrino is the godfather of Sinatra.

== Preface

Padrino is a ruby framework built upon the excellent Sinatra Microframework
[http://www.sinatrarb.com].

Sinatra is a DSL for creating simple web applications in Ruby with speed and
minimal effort.

This framework tries hard to make it as fun and easy as possible to code much
more advanced web applications by building upon the Sinatra philosophies and
foundation.
