This module implements a very simple parser for cookies used in
HTTP applications. We've found CGI::Simple::Cookie and CGI::Cookie
rather slow according to the profiling results for our OpenResty
project, hence the rewrite in C.

Special effort has been made to ensure this module works in the
same way as the latest CGI::Cookie (i.e., the pure Perl implementation).
If you find it doesn't, please let us know.
