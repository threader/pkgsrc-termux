This subclass of Rose::HTML::Form::Field::Text is intended to make
it easier to integrate Ajax autocompletion into your web applications.
You define a URL where your web application can find suggested
values for the field, and optionally, a limit on the number of
suggestions returned by the server.

This subclass is expected to be used with
Catalyst::Controller::Rose::Autocomplete but that is not required.
