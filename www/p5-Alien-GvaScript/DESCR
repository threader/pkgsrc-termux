GvaScript is a javascript framework, built on top of the prototype
object-oriented javascript framework (http://prototype.conio.net)
and offers a number of extensions and widgets, such as keymap
handling, application-specific events, autocompletion on input
field, and a tree navigator.
GvaScript is distributed using Perl tools, but the actual content
of the library is pure javascript.
