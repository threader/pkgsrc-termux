It's easy to create memory leaks in Catalyst applications and often they're
hard to find. This module tries to help you finding them by automatically
checking for common causes of leaks.

Right now, only one cause for leaks is looked for: putting a closure, that
closes over the Catalyst context (often called $ctx or $c), onto the stash,
without weakening the reference first. More checks might be implemented in
the future.

This module is intended for debugging only. I suggest to not enable it in a
production environment.
