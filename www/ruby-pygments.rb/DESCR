# pygments.rb

A Ruby wrapper for the Python [pygments syntax
highlighter](http://pygments.org/).

pygments.rb works by talking over a simple pipe to a long-lived Python child
process. This library replaces
[github/albino](https://github.com/github/albino), as well as a version of
pygments.rb that used an embedded Python interpreter.

Each Ruby process that runs has its own 'personal Python'; for example, 4
Unicorn workers will have one Python process each.  If a Python process dies,
a new one will be spawned on the next pygments.rb request.
