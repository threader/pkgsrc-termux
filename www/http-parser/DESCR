An parser for HTTP messages written in C, parsing both requests
and responses. It is designed to be used in performance oriented
HTTP applications. It does not make any syscalls nor allocations,
it does not buffer data, it can be interrupted at anytime. Depending
on your architecture, it only requires about 40 bytes of data per
message stream (in a web server that is per connection).
