The Perl 5 module Plack::Middleware::Deflater is a middleware to
encode your response body in gzip or deflate, based on Accept-Encoding
HTTP request header. It would save the bandwidth a little bit but
should increase the Plack server load, so ideally you should handle
this on the frontend reverse proxy servers.
