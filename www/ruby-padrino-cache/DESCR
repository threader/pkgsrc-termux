= Painless Page and Fragment Caching (padrino-cache)

== Overview

This component enables caching of an application's response contents on
both page- and fragment-levels. Output cached in this manner is persisted,
until it expires or is actively expired, in a configurable store of your
choosing. Several common caching stores are supported out of the box.
