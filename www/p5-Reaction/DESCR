Reaction is a Catalyst extension providing you with:
- Model mutations abstracted into Action objects.
- Reflection to generate interface models using the Action objects
from a DBIx::Class schema.
- An abstract UI expression system based on view, skin, rendering
context, widget and layout set.
- Stylable via skins. Parts of the skins can be extended and flexibly
from large down to very small parts.
- Full separation of interface rendering structure and templating,
making re-usable extensions even easier.
