You will need to make SOGo accessible through your HTTP server.
If you are running Apache then you may add the following lines to httpd.conf:

        Include ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/SOGo.conf

Next, setup a PostgreSQL or MySQL database with a sogo user. Tweak tbe
${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/sogo-conf.sh script according to your needs, run it, and
start httpd and sogod:

        /etc/rc.d/sogod start
        /etc/rc.d/apache start
