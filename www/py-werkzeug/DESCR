Werkzeug is a WSGI utility library for Python. It's widely used
and BSD licensed.

Werkzeug started as a simple collection of various utilities for
WSGI applications and has become one of the most advanced WSGI
utility modules. It includes a powerful debugger, fully featured
request and response objects, HTTP utilities to handle entity tags,
cache control headers, HTTP dates, cookie handling, file uploads,
a powerful URL routing system and a bunch of community contributed
addon modules.

It does Unicode and doesn't enforce a specific template engine,
database adapter or anything else. It doesn't even enforce a specific
way of handling requests and leaves all that up to the developer.
