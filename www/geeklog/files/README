1. First, create a database for Geeklog.

	# mysqladmin -p -u <administrator> create <dbname>.

2. Next, create a user for accessing that database.

	# mysql -p -u <administrator> <dbname>
	mysql> grant select, insert, update, delete, create, drop,
	       index, alter, create temporary tables, lock tables on
	       <dbname>.* to '<dbuser>'@'localhost'
	       identified by '<dbpass>' ;


3. You will need to make Geeklog accessible through your HTTP server.
   If you are running Apache then you may add the following lines to
   httpd.conf:

	Include @PKG_SYSCONFDIR@/geeklog.conf

   This geeklog.conf assumes that Geeklog would be accessed with
   "/geeklog" sub directory.

   Since you had better limit the access until complete Geeklog setup,
   geeklog.conf limit access to "localhost".  After complete your setup,
   please relax this access restriction.

4. Complete install or upgrade, access below URL and follow the
   instruction.

	http://localhost/geeklog/admin/install/

5. Last, you should remove whole @PREFIX@/@GEEKLOG_PUB@/admin directory.

You can read documentation for install Geeklog:

	http://localhost/geeklog/docs/install.html
