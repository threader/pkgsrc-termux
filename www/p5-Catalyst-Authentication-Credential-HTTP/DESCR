This module provides the feature of HTTP authentication for
Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication. Both basic and digest authentication
are currently supported.

When authentication is required, this module sets a status of 401, and
the body of the response to 'Authorization required.'. To override this
and set some own content, check for the $c->res->status == 401 in the
end action, and change the body accordingly.
