CGI::Ajax is an object-oriented module that provides a unique
mechanism for using perl code asynchronously from javascript-
enhanced HTML pages. CGI::Ajax unburdens the user from having to
write extensive javascript, except for associating an exported
method with a document-defined event (such as onClick, onKeyUp,
etc). CGI::Ajax also mixes well with HTML containing more complex
javascript.
