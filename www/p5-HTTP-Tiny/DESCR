This is a very simple HTTP/1.1 client, designed for doing simple GET
requests without the overhead of a large framework like LWP::UserAgent.

It is more correct and more complete than HTTP::Lite. It supports proxies
(currently only non-authenticating ones) and redirection. It also correctly
resumes after EINTR.
