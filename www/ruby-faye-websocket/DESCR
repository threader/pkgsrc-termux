faye-websocket is a general-purpose WebSocket implementation
extracted from the Faye project. It provides classes for easily
building WebSocket servers and clients in Ruby. It does not
provide a server itself, but rather makes it easy to handle
WebSocket connections within an existing Rack application.
It does not provide any abstraction other than the standard
WebSocket API.

It also provides an abstraction for handling EventSource connections,
which are one-way connections that allow the server to push data
to the client. They are based on streaming HTTP responses and can
be easier to access via proxies than WebSockets.
