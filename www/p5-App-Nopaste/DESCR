Pastebins (also known as nopaste sites) let you post text, usually
code, for public viewing. They're used a lot in IRC channels to
show code that would normally be too long to give directly in the
channel (hence the name nopaste).

Each pastebin is slightly different. When one pastebin goes down
then you have to find a new one. And if you usually use a script
to publish text, then it's too much hassle.

The Perl 5 module App::Nopaste aims to smooth out the differences
between pastebins, and provides redundancy: if one site doesn't
work, it just tries a different one. A commande line script is
provided.
