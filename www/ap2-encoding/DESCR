This module improves non-ascii filename interoperability of apache
(and mod_dav).

It seems many WebDAV clients send filename in its platform-local
encoding. But since mod_dav expects everything, even HTTP request
line, to be in UTF-8, this causes an interoperability problem.

I believe this is a future issue for specification (RFC?) to
standardize encoding used in HTTP request-line and HTTP header, but
life would be much easier if mod_dav (and others) can handle various
encodings sent by clients, TODAY. This module does just that.

This module adds following directives: EncodingEngine, SetServerEncoding,
AddClientEncoding, DefaultClientEncoding, and NormalizeUsername.

Note by maintainer:
	It also solves the problem with the "hostname\\username"
	way of authentication that Windows machines do when they
	attach to a DAV server. See the use of the NormalizeUsername
	directive.
