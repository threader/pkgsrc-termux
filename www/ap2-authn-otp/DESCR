mod_authn_otp is an Apache web server module for two-factor authentication
using one-time passwords (OTP) generated via the HOTP/OATH algorithm
defined in RFC 4226. This creates a simple way to protect a web site with
one-time passwords, using any RFC 4226-compliant hardware or software
token device. mod_authn_otp also supports the Mobile-OTP algorithm.
