Catalyst is an elegant web application framework, extremely flexible
yet extremely simple. It's similar to Ruby on Rails, Spring (Java)
and Maypole, upon which it was originally based.

This is a Catalyst Engine implementing a job queue with POE. It
allows the launching of HTTP requests to the application at
predetermined moments in time and the subsequent capturing of
response to a logfile or an email address.
