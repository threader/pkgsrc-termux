Uses the Cache::Cache hierarchy by default to implement a caching
Mech. This lets one perform repeated requests without hammering a
server impolitely.
  Please note that Cache::Cache has been superceded by CHI, but the
default has not been changed here for reasons of backwards
compatibility. For this reason, you are encouraged to provide your own
CHI caching object to override the default.
