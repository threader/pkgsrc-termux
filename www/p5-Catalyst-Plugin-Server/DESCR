Base plugin for XMLRPC and SOAP server.

XMLRPC Plugin for Catalyst which we tried to make compatible with
the way Catalyst works with URLS. Main features are:

    * Split XMLRPC methodNames by STRING to find out Controller.
    * Single entrypoint for XMLRPC calls, like http://host.tld/rpc
    * DispatchTypes (attributes) which work much the same as Catalyst attrs
    * XMLRPC Parameter handling transparent to Catalyst parameter handling
