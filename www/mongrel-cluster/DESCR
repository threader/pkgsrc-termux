This package is a Mongrel plugin to help start/stop/restart multiple
mongrel servers to use behind a load balancer like Apache 2.2
(mod_proxy_balancer), Lighttpd, Pound, Pen or Balance.  This plugin
adds an option to specify a number of Mongrel servers to launch, a
range of ports, and a configuration file for the cluster.
