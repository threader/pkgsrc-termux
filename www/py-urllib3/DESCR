HTTP library with thread-safe connection pooling, file post, and more.

Highlights

  * Re-use the same socket connection for multiple requests (HTTPConnectionPool
    and HTTPSConnectionPool) (with optional client-side certificate
    verification).
  * File posting (encode_multipart_formdata).
  * Built-in redirection and retries (optional).
  * Supports gzip and deflate decoding.
  * Thread-safe and sanity-safe.
  * Works with AppEngine, gevent, and eventlib.
  * Tested on Python 2.6+ and Python 3.2+, 100% unit test coverage.
  * Small and easy to understand codebase perfect for extending and building
    upon. For a more comprehensive solution, have a look at Requests which is
    also powered by urllib3.
