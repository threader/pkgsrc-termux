This Action handles doing automatic method dispatching for REST
requests. It takes a normal Catalyst action, and changes the dispatch
to append an underscore and method name.

For example, in the synopsis above, calling GET on "/foo" would
result in the foo_GET method being dispatched.

If a method is requested that is not implemented, this action will
return a status 405 (Method Not Found). It will populate the "Allow"
header with the list of implemented request methods. You can override
this behavior by implementing a custom 405 handler like so:

   sub foo_not_implemented {
      ... handle not implemented methods ...
   }

If you do not provide an _OPTIONS subroutine, we will automatically
respond with a 200 OK. The "Allow" header will be populated with
the list of implemented request methods.

It is likely that you really want to look at Catalyst::Controller::REST,
which brings this class together with automatic Serialization of
requests and responses.
