"Don't put emails directly on the page, they will be scraped"

Stuff that, I'm sick of looking at "bob at smith dot com". Why can't
we just write emails in a way that looks normal to people, but is
very, very difficult to scrape off. Most email scrapers only use
very very simple parsing methods. And it isn't as if it is hard to
just do

  # Before we search for email addresses...
  $page =~ s/\s+at\s+/@/g;
  $page =~ s/\s+dot\s+/./g;

This is an arms war dammit, and I want nukes!
