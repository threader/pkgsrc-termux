HTTP::Cookie is a ruby library to handle HTTP cookies in a way both
compliant with RFCs and compatible with today's major browsers.

It was originally a part of the
[Mechanize](https://github.com/sparklemotion/mechanize) library,
separated as an independent library in the hope of serving as a common
component that is reusable from any HTTP related piece of software.

The following is an incomplete list of its features:

* Its behavior is highly compatible with that of today's major web
  browsers.

* It is based on and conforms to RFC 6265 (the latest standard for the
  HTTP cookie mechanism) to a high extent, with real world conventions
  deeply in mind.

* It takes eTLD (effective TLD, also known as "Public Suffix") into
  account just as major browsers do, to reject cookies with an eTLD
  domain like "org", "co.jp", or "appspot.com".  This feature is
  brought to you by the domain_name gem.

* The number of cookies and the size are properly capped so that a
  cookie store does not get flooded.

* It supports the legacy Netscape cookies.txt format for
  serialization, maximizing the interoperability with other
  implementations.

* It supports the cookies.sqlite format adopted by Mozilla Firefox for
  backend store database which can be shared among multiple program
  instances.

* It is relatively easy to add a new serialization format or a backend
  store because of its modular API.
