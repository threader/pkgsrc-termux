Squid proxy native log analyser and reports generator with full statistics
about times, hits, bytes, users, networks, top urls and top domains. Statistic
reports are oriented toward user and bandwidth control; this is not a pure
cache statistics generator.

SquidAnalyzer use flat files to store data and don't need any SQL, SQL Lite or
Berkeley databases.

This log analyzer is incremental and should be run in a daily cron or more
often on huge network trafic.
