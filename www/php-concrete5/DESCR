Concrete5 is a content management system (CMS) that can manage Web
applications, Web sites, stores, and forums. It allows individuals
involved with Web sites to easily manage their content and their
site structure. Concrete5's in-context editing is like working with
a wiki, and the extendable block support makes editing and extending
unique Web sites easy. The goal behind Concrete5 was always to
create a toolset that could be used by anyone with basic computer
skills to edit and add pages to a Web site.
