Stateful programmatic web browsing, after Andy Lester's Perl module
WWW::Mechanize.

The library is layered: mechanize.Browser (stateful web browser),
mechanize.UserAgent (configurable URL opener), plus urllib2 handlers.

Features include: ftp:, http: and file: URL schemes, browser history,
high-level hyperlink and HTML form support, HTTP cookies, HTTP-EQUIV
and Refresh, Referer [sic] header, robots.txt, redirections, proxies,
and Basic and Digest HTTP authentication.  mechanize's response
objects are (lazily-) .seek()able and still work after .close().
