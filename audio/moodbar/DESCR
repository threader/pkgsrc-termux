The Moodbar is an algorithm for creating a colorful visual
representation of the contents of an audio file, giving an idea of
its "mood" (this is a rather fanciful term for the simple analysis
it actually does).  The Moodbar was invented by Gavin Wood and
Simon O'Keefe for inclusion in the Amarok music player.

This package contains a GStreamer plugin with elements that are
used in the moodbar analysis, and an application that actually does
the analysis.
