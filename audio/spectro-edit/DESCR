Spectro-Edit reads in regular PCM audio files (currently, only
16-bit mono WAV is supported), then shows you the audio visually
in a time vs. frequency plot.

The fun part is, you can "paint out" any part of the visualization
and play back the audio subject to your modifications. When you
are happy with the result, you can save your work back to a WAV
file.

This could be useful for podcasting (edit out microphone noise,
chair squeaks, phones ringing, and other background noise), music
(make strange and unusual modifications to the sound for artistic
reasons), research (visualize animal calls or noise pollution from
nearby industrial activity), and general purpose geekery (which is
why I made it).
