Finds problems in MP3 files and helps the user to fix many of them. Looks
at both the audio part (VBR info, quality, normalization) and the tags
containing track information (ID3.)

Has a tag editor, which can download album information (including cover art)
from MusicBrainz and Discogs, as well as paste data from the clipboard.
Track information can also be extracted from a file's name.

Another component is the file renamer, which can rename files based on
the fields in their ID3V2 tag (artist, track number, album, genre, ...)
