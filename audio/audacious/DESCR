Audacious is a media player used to play audio and other kinds of
media files. It is a fork of beep-media-player 0.9.7.1. The primary
goals of this fork are keeping the ideology of the original BMP
and merging miscellaneous plugins into Audacious.

Audacious can be extended through plugins to play a number of other
audio and video formats. (The audio/audacious-plugins package
provides the standard plugins needed to actually play music.)
