Opus is a totally open, royalty-free, highly versatile audio codec.
Opus is unmatched for interactive speech and music transmission
over the Internet, but also intended for storage and streaming
applications. It is standardized by the Internet Engineering Task
Force (IETF) as RFC 6716 which incorporated technology from Skype's
SILK codec and Xiph.Org's CELT codec.
