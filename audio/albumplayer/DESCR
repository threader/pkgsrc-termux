Album Player is a lightweight GTK-based audio player. Many people archive
their CD and record collections into a single FLAC file for every record,
accompanied by a cue sheet that holds the track information. Album Player
is made specifically for the task of playing FLAC files that have such a
cue sheet, a track list and cover art embedded.
