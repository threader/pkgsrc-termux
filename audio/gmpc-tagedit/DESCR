The tagedit plugin for GMPC adds a editor panel for editing song
tags. With the plugin enabled, you are able to queue one or more
songs to the Tag editor from the playlist or song browser. You may
then enter the Tag editor panel and modify the tags of the queued
songs one by one or by groups. The changes are recorded when you
hit the Save button. If you made a mistake while editing tags, you
may discard the changes you made to one song or a group of songs.
