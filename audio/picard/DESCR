Picard is the next generation MusicBrainz tagging application. This new
tagging concept is album oriented, as opposed to track/file oriented
like the ClassicTagger was. Picard is written in Python, which is a
cross-platform language, and makes use of cross-platform libraries -
this allows the same code to run both on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.
