BLOP comprises a set of LADSPA  plugins that generate bandlimited sawtooth,
square, variable pulse and slope-variable triangle waves, principally for use
with one of the many modular software synthesisers available.

They are wavetable based, and are designed to produce output with harmonic
content as high as possible over a wide pitch range.

Additionally, there are a few extra plugins to assist in building synthesis
networks. Full details can be found in the List-o-Plugins
