SDL_mixer is a sample multi-channel audio mixer library. It supports any number
of simultaneously playing channels of 16 bit stereo audio, plus a single channel
of music, mixed by the popular FLAC, MikMod MOD, Timidity MIDI, Ogg Vorbis, and
SMPEG MP3 libraries.

As of SDL_mixer 1.2.7, FLAC, MikMod, Ogg Vorbis and MP3 loading libraries are
dynamically loaded, so if you don't need to load those formats, you don't need
to include those shared libraries.
