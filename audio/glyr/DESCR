Glyr comes both in a commandline interface tool and as a C library, both with an
easy to use interface. The sort of metadata glyr is searching (and downloading)
is usually the data you see in your music player. And indeed, originally it was
written to serve as internally library for a music player, but has been extended
to work as a standalone program.
