xmms-cdread - plugin for xmms.

At the moment, the idea is to add /dev/cdrom to your playlist.
If you have multiple CDROM units (like a burner) you can add all
those devices to the playlist and it should work.

I know this exists already, but that's such an ugly hack I decided to
make my own version, which actually reads the audio data, and will also
not need the subdirectory trick to get the tracks into the playlist:
The tracks will be added and removed automatically as CDs are inserted
and removed.

It now has CDDB support, local database editing as well as server queries.
