MilkyTracker is an open source, multi-platform music application for creating
.MOD and .XM module files. It attempts to recreate the module replay and user

modes available for improved Amiga ProTracker 2/3 compatibility.

Some of its key features are:

  and for exchanging data between them

* In-depth instrument editor featuring envelope zooming and scaling and support
  for copying and swapping instruments and samples across tabs
* ProTracker 2/3 playback modes for playing and editing .MOD files
* Various resampler options including emulated Amiga 500/1200 sound output
* Module optimizer
* Over 30 imported module formats
