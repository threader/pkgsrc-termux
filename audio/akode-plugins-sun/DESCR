aKode is a simple audio decoding framework that provides a uniform interface
to decode the most common audio formats. It also has a direct playback option
for a number of audio outputs.

This package provides the sun plugin for aKode which allows playback through
sound devices via API used in Sun OS/Solaris, NetBSD and OpenBSD.
