eyeD3 is a Python tool for working with audio files, specifically
mp3 files containing ID3 metadata (i.e. song info).

It provides a command-line tool (``eyeD3``) and a Python library
(``import eyed3``) that can be used to write your own applications
or plugins that are callable from the command-line tool.
