sfxr's original purpose was to provide a simple means of getting
basic sound effects into a game for those people who were working
hard to get their entries done for the Ludum Dare gaming contest
within the 48 hours and didn't have time to spend looking for
suitable ways of doing this.

The idea was that they could just hit a few buttons in this
application and get some largely randomized effects that were custom
in the sense that the user could accept/reject each proposed sound.
