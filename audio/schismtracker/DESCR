Schism Tracker is a free reimplementation of Impulse Tracker, a program
used to create high quality music without the requirements of specialized,
expensive equipment, and with a unique "finger feel" that is difficult to
replicate in part. The player is based on a highly modified version of
the Modplug engine, with a number of bugfixes and changes to improve IT
playback.
