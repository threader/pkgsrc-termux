QjackCtl is a simple Qt application to control the JACK sound server
daemon, specific for the Linux Audio Desktop infrastructure.

Written in C++ around the Qt4 toolkit for X11, most exclusively using
Qt Designer.

Provides a simple GUI dialog for setting several JACK daemon parameters,
which are properly saved between sessions, and a way control of the status
of the audio server daemon. With time, this primordial interface has become
richer by including a enhanced patchbay and connection control features.
