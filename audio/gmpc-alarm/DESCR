The GNOME Music Player Client is a GTK+ client for remote access,
control and playlist management of the Music Player Daemon featuring
ID3 Support and a tray icon for your notification area.

The Alarm Timer plugin turns your music player into an alarm, set
the time in at which it must go off and the rest is done by gmpc.
