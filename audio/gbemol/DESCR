gbemol allows you to use MPD with a userfriendly interface.
Features include an easy-to-use, tag-oriented library browser,
a two mode playlist, cover art support (APIC tag only, for now),
system tray icon docking, song, album and artist information.

Music Player Daemon is a server that allows remote access for playing
audio files, streams and managing playlists. The daemon is controlled
through a client which need not run on the same computer mpd runs on.
