`Chromaprint`_ and its associated `Acoustid`_ Web service make up a
high-quality, open-source acoustic fingerprinting system. This package provides
Python bindings for both the fingerprinting algorithm library, which is written
in C but portable, and the Web service, which provides fingerprint lookups.
