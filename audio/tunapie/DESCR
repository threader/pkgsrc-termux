TunaPie is a directory browser for Internet radio and TV streams.
As of 0.9.6, it is compatible with the Icecast directory as well as the
Shoutcast (winamp) stream directory service.

Tunapie allows you to search for streams and then launch your audio player
(XMMS) or NSV viewer (Mplayer) of choice. It also allows recording of audio
and video streams using streamripper.
