OpenMPT based module player library and libopenmpt based command-line
player

libopenmpt is a cross-platform C++ and C library to decode tracked
music files (modules) into a raw PCM audio stream.

openmpt123 is a cross-platform command-line or terminal based module
file player.

libopenmpt is based on the player code of the Open ModPlug Tracker
project (OpenMPT, http://openmpt.org/). In order to avoid code base
fragmentation, libopenmpt is developed in the same source code
repository as OpenMPT.
