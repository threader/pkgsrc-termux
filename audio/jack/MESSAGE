$NetBSD: MESSAGE,v 1.1 2008/07/31 03:58:05 bjs Exp $

NOTE:  Unfortunately, JACK wants to use a linux /proc filesystem to
perform shared memory housekeeping tasks.  Therefore, if your platform
supports a "Linux-compliant" proc filesystem, we recommend mounting one
prior to using jack.  On NetBSD, this can be accomplished with the
following command:

		mount_procfs -orw,linux /proc <mount point>

Conventionally, the mount point is /proc.  If you wish to use a different
pathname for this filesystem, you may define the JACKD_PROCFS_PATH
variable in your build environment or mk.conf as shown below.

		JACKD_PROCFS_PATH= /emul/linux/proc

ATTENTION:  NetBSD-current users who wish to run jackd with real-time
	    scheduling will likely find that the loader fails to mmap
	    the driver module(s) when using -R.  Until this issue is re-
	    solved, one may work around this problem by using the -m
	    (--no-mlock) option.
