Suil is a lightweight C library for loading and wrapping LV2 plugin
UIs.

Suil makes it possible to load a UI of any toolkit in a host using
any other toolkit (assuming the toolkits are both supported by
Suil). Hosts do not need to build against or link to foreign toolkit
libraries to use UIs written with that toolkit; all the necessary
magic is performed by dynamically loaded modules. The API is designed
such that hosts do not need to explicitly support specific toolkits
at all - if Suil supports a particular toolkit, then UIs in that
toolkit will work in all hosts that use Suil automatically.
